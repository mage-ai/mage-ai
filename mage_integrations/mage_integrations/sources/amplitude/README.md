## Query

Loading data from Amplitude requires a start date and an end date.

Mage will automatically pass the start date and end date to Amplitude depending on the
scheduled trigger you create.

For example, if you create a scheduled trigger that runs daily, then on each pipeline run the
start date will be 1 day ago and the end date will be today’s date.

If you want to hardcode and customize the start date and end date,
follow these [instructions to override the runtime variables](../../../docs/production/runtime_variables.md)
for your pipeline.

Add the following keys and sample values to your pipeline’s variables:

| Key | Description | Sample value
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_start_date` | The date to start fetching events from Amplitude. | `2022-10-01` |
| `_end_date` | The date to stop fetching events from Amplitude. | `2022-10-03` |
