A backfill creates 1 or more pipeline runs for a pipeline. There are 2 types of backfills:

1. Date and time window
1. Custom code

## Date and time window

Create 1 or more pipeline runs between 2 datetime values.

The datetime of each instance is used as the `execution_date` for the pipeline run.

For example, if the backfill has the following attributes:

| Attribute | Value|
| --- | --- |
| Start datetime | `2023-01-01T03:00:00` |
| End datetime | `2023-01-05T03:00:00` |
| Interval type | `day` |
| Interval units | `2` |

Then the following pipeline runs will be created:

| `id` | `execution_date` | `ds` | `hr` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `2023-01-01T03:00:00` | `2023-01-01` | `03` |
| 2 | `2023-01-03T03:00:00` | `2023-01-03` | `03` |

## Custom code

The output of a backfill code will be used to generate the pipeline runs.

For example, if the backfill code has the following content:

```python
backfill_data = []

for index, _ in range(3):
    backfill_data.append(dict(
        partition=index,
        power=5,
    ))

backfill_data
```

Then the following pipeline runs will be created:


| `id` | `execution_date` | `ds` | `hr` | `partition` | `power` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `2023-01-01T00:00:00` | `2023-01-01` | `00` | `0` | `5` |
| 2 | `2023-01-01T00:00:00` | `2023-01-01` | `00` | `1` | `5` |
| 3 | `2023-01-01T00:00:00` | `2023-01-01` | `00` | `2` | `5` |
