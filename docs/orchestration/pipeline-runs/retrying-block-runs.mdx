## Automatic retry
Mage supports configuring automatic retry for block runs with the following ways
1. Add `retry_config` to project's `metadata.yaml`. This `retry_config` will be applied to all block runs.
   Here is an example:
    ```yaml
    retry_config:
      # Number of retry times
      retries: 3
      # Initial delay before retry. If exponential_backoff is true,
      # the delay time is multiplied by 2 for the next retry
      delay: 5
      # Maximum time between the first attempt and the last retry
      max_delay: 60
      # Whether to use exponential backoff retry
      exponential_backoff: true
    ```
2. Add `retry_config` to the block config in pipeline's `metadata.yaml`. The block level `retry_config` will
   override the global `retry_config`. Here is an example
    ```yaml
    blocks:
    - uuid: example_data_loader
      type: data_loader
      upstream_blocks: []
      downstream_blocks: []
      retry_config:
        retries: 2
        delay: 5
        max_delay: 10
        exponential_backoff: false
      ...
    ```

## Retry incomplete blocks

- Supported pipeline types: Integration and Standard pipelines
- If a pipeline run fails, you can retry from the failed block
run (instead of retrying the entire pipeline run) by going to the individual
pipeline runs page (`/pipelines/[pipeline_uuid]/runs/[pipeline_run_id]`).
- At the top of the individual pipeline runs page, there should be a red
`Retry incomplete blocks` button. Click on it, and the block runs should
retry from the failed block.

## Retry from selected block

- Supported pipeline types: Integration and Standard pipelines
- If you want to retry block runs for a pipeline run starting from a specific
block (regardless of the block run's status), go to the same page for the individual
pipeline run.
- Select a block run row, and a blue `Retry from selected block` button should appear.
- Note that the `Retry from selected block` button will only appear if the pipeline
run is not currently running.
- If there is a failed block run and you try to retry from a selected block that is
downstream from that failed block, you may get `upstream_failed` block run errors.

### Accessing the individual pipeline runs page

1. Click on a pipeline from the main Pipelines Dashboard.
2. Click on the `Runs` section or on an individual trigger from the `Triggers` section.
3. Underneath the `Block runs` column of the pipeline runs table, there is a link that
says something like `See block runs (x)`. Click on that link to redirect to the
individual pipeline runs page, which lists the blocks runs specific to a pipeline run.
