## How to trigger a pipeline

There are 2 ways you can trigger a pipeline from code:

### Block template

Add a [data loader](/development/blocks/data_loaders/templates#trigger-pipeline)
or [data exporter](/development/blocks/data_exporters/templates#trigger-pipeline)
block template named `Orchestration → Trigger pipeline`.

### Custom code

Add a block and use the following code example within the block’s function:

```python
from mage_ai.orchestration.triggers.api import trigger_pipeline


trigger_pipeline(
    'pipeline_uuid',
    variables={},
    check_status=False,
    error_on_failure=False,
    poll_interval=60,
    poll_timeout=None,
    verbose=True,
)
```

## Parameters

| `variables` | Runtime variables for the pipeline. | `{}` | `{ 'env': 'dev' }` | |
| `check_status` | Poll and check the status of the triggered pipeline. | `False` | `False` or `True` | |
