## Trigger

A trigger is a set of instructions that determine when or how a pipeline should
run. A pipeline can have 1 or more triggers.

There are 3 types of triggers:

1. Schedule
2. Event
3. API

#### Schedule

A schedule-type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run after a start date and
on a set interval.

Currently, the frequency pipelines can be scheduled for include:

- Run exactly once
- Hourly
- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Every N minutes (coming soon)

#### Event

An event-type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run whenever a specific
event occurs.

For example, you can have a pipeline start running when a database query is
finished executing or when a new object is created in Amazon S3 or Google
Storage.

You can also trigger a pipeline using your own custom event by making a `POST`
request to the `http://localhost/api/events` endpoint with a custom event
payload.

#### API

An API-type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run after a specific API call
is made.

You can make a POST request to an endpoint provided in the UI when creating or
editing a trigger. You can optionally include runtime variables in your request
payload.

#### Additional trigger settings
* Overwrite global variables
  * You can overwrite the global variables that are defined in the pipeline to differentiate the variables used in different triggers.
  * The `Overwrite global variables` option won't show if you don't have any global variables defined in the pipeline.
* (Schedule triggers only) Skip run if previous run still in progress
  * Enabling this setting will tell the scheduler to not initialize the current run if any
    previous run for this trigger is still in progress.
* (Schedule triggers only) [available starting in v0.9.62] Create initial pipeline run if start date is before current execution period
  * Enabling this setting will create an initial pipeline run if the pipeline schedule's current
    execution date is after its start datetime but before the current time.
  * For example, if the current time is `1/4/24 12:00 UTC` and you create a daily trigger with a start date of `1/3/24 12:00 UTC` and
    then enable it, a pipeline run with execution date `2024-01-04 00:00` (after the start date time but before the current time) gets
    immediately created, even though the "next run date" is `2024-01-05 00:00`, which is the next pipeline run date in the future
    after `1/4/24 12:00`.
* Allow blocks to fail
  * Enabling this setting will tell the scheduler to continue running the trigger even if 
    a block in the pipeline fails during the execution. The pipeline will continue to run 
    blocks that are not dependent on the failed blocks until the pipeline is complete.
