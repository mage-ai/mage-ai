  "An event-type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run whenever a specific
  event occurs."
---

For example, you can have a pipeline start running when a database query is
finished executing or when a new object is created in Amazon S3 or Google
Storage.

You can also trigger a pipeline using your own custom event by making a POST
request to the http://localhost/api/events endpoint with a custom event payload.
