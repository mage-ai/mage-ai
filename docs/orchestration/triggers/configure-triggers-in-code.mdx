In addition to configuring triggers via UI, you can also configure triggers in code.

You can either manually define the triggers in code or you can go to the triggers detail page in the
UI and click the button labeled <b>Save trigger in code</b> on the left side panel to store the
current triggerâ€™s settings to code.

## Create and configure triggers

Here are the steps to create and configure triggers via code:
1. Create a `triggers.yaml` file under your pipeline folder. The file path should be `pipelines/[pipeline_uuid]/triggers.yaml`.
1. Enter your trigger configs into the `triggers.yaml` file.
    1. Content structure
        ```yaml
        triggers:
        - name: test_trigger
          schedule_type: time
          start_time: 2023-01-01
          status: active
        - name: xxx
          ...
        - name: xxx
          ...
        ```
    1. Required trigger fields
        1. `name`: Unique identifier of the trigger
        1. `schedule_type`: `time`, `api`, or `event`
        1. `schedule_interval`: `@once`, `@hourly`, `@daily`, `@weekly`, `@monthly`, `@always_on`, or Cron syntax(`* * * * *`)
        1. `start_time`: The start time of the trigger (e.g. `2023-01-01`)
    1. Optional trigger fields
        1. `status`: `active` or `inactive`
        1. `variables`: A dictionary of variables that's associated with the trigger
        1. `sla`: SLA in seconds
        1. `settings`: a dictionary of [advanced settings](/guides/triggering-pipelines#additional-trigger-settings)
            1. `skip_if_previous_running`: `true`/`false`
            1. `allow_blocks_to_fail`: `true`/`false`
        1. `envs`: The environments that the trigger runs in. If envs is not set or empty, the trigger will run in all environments. The environment of the Mage app is set via `ENV` [environment variable](/development/variables/environment-variables). Supported `envs` values: `dev`, `staging`, `prod`, `test`.
1. Save the `triggers.yaml` file. The trigger configs will be synced to the triggers UI shortly.


### Example triggers config:

```yaml
triggers:
- name: test_example_trigger
  schedule_type: time
  schedule_interval: "@daily"
  start_time: 2023-01-01
  status: active
- name: test_example_trigger_2
  schedule_type: time
  schedule_interval: "@hourly"
  start_time: 2023-03-01
  status: inactive
- name: test_example_trigger_with_extra_settings
  schedule_type: time
  schedule_interval: "@hourly"
  start_time: 2023-03-01
  status: inactive
  settings:
    skip_if_previous_running: true
    allow_blocks_to_fail: true
  envs:
  - prod
  - dev
```

## Modify triggers

If an existing trigger is configured in the yaml file, any updates to it through the UI will also update
trigger config in the yaml file. If you modify the trigger settings directly in the yaml, it will
automatically update the trigger in the UI. The new trigger configs are synced to the triggers in UI.


## Delete triggers

If you don't want to use a trigger anymore, you can either update the trigger status to `inactive` or
delete the trigger completely.

To delete the trigger completely, you can delete the trigger from the UI by clicking the delete button
(with trash can icon) in the Pipeline triggers table (`/pipeline/[pipeline_uuid]/triggers`). This will
also remove the trigger from the pipeline's `triggers.yaml` config file.
