In addition to configuring triggers via UI, you can also configure triggers in code.

You can either manually define the triggers in code or you can go to the triggers detail page in the
UI and click the button labeled <b>Save trigger in code</b> on the left side panel to store the
current trigger’s settings to code.

## Create and configure triggers

Here are the steps to create and configure triggers via code:
1. Create a `triggers.yaml` file under your pipeline folder. The file path should be `pipelines/[pipeline_uuid]/triggers.yaml`.
1. Enter your trigger configs into the `triggers.yaml` file.
    1. Content structure
        ```yaml
        triggers:
        - name: test_trigger
          schedule_type: time
          start_time: 2023-01-01
          status: active
        - name: xxx
          ...
        - name: xxx
          ...
        ```
    1. Required trigger fields
        1. `name`: Unique identifier of the trigger
        1. `schedule_type`: `time`, `api`, or `event`
        1. `schedule_interval`: `@once`, `@hourly`, `@daily`, `@weekly`, `@monthly`, `@always_on`, or Cron syntax(`* * * * *`)
        1. `start_time`: The start time of the trigger (e.g. `2023-01-01`)
    1. Optional trigger fields
        1. `status`: `active` or `inactive`
        1. `variables`: A dictionary of variables that's associated with the trigger
        1. `sla`: SLA in seconds
        1. `settings`: a dictionary of [advanced settings](/orchestration/triggers/triggering-pipelines#additional-trigger-settings)
            1. `skip_if_previous_running`: `true`/`false`
            1. `allow_blocks_to_fail`: `true`/`false`
            1. `create_initial_pipeline_run`: `true`/`false`
        1. `envs`: The environments that the trigger runs in.
            - If `envs` is not set or empty, the trigger will run in all environments.
            - The environment of the Mage app is set via the `ENV` [environment variable](/development/variables/environment-variables).
            - **OSS:** Only supports `dev`, `staging`, `prod`, `test`.
            - **Mage Pro:** Supports any value, which must match the `ENV` environment variable.

1. Save the `triggers.yaml` file. The trigger configs will be synced to the triggers UI shortly.


### Example triggers config:

```yaml
triggers:
- name: test_example_trigger
  schedule_type: time
  schedule_interval: "@daily"
  start_time: 2023-01-01
  status: active
- name: test_example_trigger_2
  schedule_type: time
  schedule_interval: "@hourly"
  start_time: 2023-03-01
  status: inactive
- name: test_example_trigger_with_extra_settings
  schedule_type: time
  schedule_interval: "@hourly"
  start_time: 2023-03-01
  status: inactive
  settings:
    skip_if_previous_running: true
    allow_blocks_to_fail: true
  envs:
  - prod
  - dev
```

## Modify triggers

If an existing trigger is configured in the yaml file, any updates to it through the UI will also update
trigger config in the yaml file. If you modify the trigger settings directly in the yaml, it will
automatically update the trigger in the UI. The new trigger configs are synced to the triggers in UI.


## Delete triggers

The `triggers.yaml` file is synced into the database automatically, but **deletions work differently**:

- **Deleting triggers completely:**
  Removing a trigger from the yaml file won’t delete it from the database. You will need to delete the trigger in the UI.
  - In the Pipeline triggers table (`/pipeline/[pipeline_uuid]/triggers`), click the trash can icon.
  - In **Mage Pro**, right-click on the trigger row and click <b>Delete</b>.

  This ensures the trigger is removed both from the database and from the pipeline’s `triggers.yaml` config file.

- **Alternative to deletion:**
  Instead of deleting, you can update the trigger status in the yaml file (e.g. set `status: inactive`).
  Status changes are automatically synced to the database and UI.
