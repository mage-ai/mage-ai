You can schedule your pipeline to run on these intervals:

- Once
- Hourly
- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Always on
    - The pipeline will be run as soon as the previous pipeline run is finished
- Custom schedule using
  [CRON Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression)
- Every minute using CRON expression: `* * * * *`
- _Streaming pipeline_: coming soon
Learn more about how to
[schedule pipelines](/design/data-pipeline-management#create-trigger).

## Landing times

If the trigger type is a schedule then instead of choosing when the pipeline will run,
you can choose the pipeline’s landing time.

This is useful if you want your data pipeline to finish at a specific time instead of start at
a specific time.

For example, a pipeline is scheduled to land daily at 17:00 UTC.
If this pipeline takes 10 hours on average to complete, then the pipeline will be triggered and
start running at 05:00 UTC each day.

### Enable landing time

When editing a trigger with schedule type, there is a toggle called `Enable landing time`.
Turn that on to enable landing time for the trigger.

### Configure landing time

Depending on the frequency, you’ll be able to configure the following times the pipeline
should complete:

- Day of the month
- Day of the week
- Hour of the day
- Minute of the hour
- Second of the minute

## Extra runtime variables from pipeline run

If your pipeline run belongs to a trigger that is scheduled, then the following extra
variables are available in your Python block’s keyword arguments (e.g. `kwargs`).

| Key | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `interval_start_datetime` | The `datetime` when the pipeline run is scheduled for. | `datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 23, 7, 0, 0, 0)` |
| `interval_end_datetime` | The `datetime` when the next pipeline run is scheduled for. | `datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 7, 0, 0, 0)` |
| `interval_seconds` | The number of seconds between the current pipeline run and the next pipeline run. | `86400` |
| `interval_start_datetime_previous` | The `datetime` when the previous pipeline run was scheduled for. | `datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 22, 7, 0, 0, 0)` |

### SQL block

If you’re using a SQL block, here is an example of how you can access these variables:

```sql
SELECT
    '{{ interval_start_datetime }}' AS interval_start_datetime
    , '{{ interval_end_datetime }}' AS interval_end_datetime
    , '{{ interval_seconds }}' AS interval_seconds
    , '{{ interval_start_datetime_previous }}' AS interval_start_datetime_previous
```
