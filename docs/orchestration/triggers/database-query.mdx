Pipeline triggres are stored in `pipeline_schedule` table in the database. If you want to query
the trigger metadata, you can either directly query the data from database or use Python code
to fetch `PipelineSchedule` models.

## Query from DB
Here is the query from Postgres. You can adapt it to the syntax of other databases when needed.
```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM pipeline_schedule
WHERE pipeline_uuid = 'example_pipeline' -- Filter by pipeline_uuid
AND status = 'ACTIVE' -- Filter by status
AND repo_path = '/home/src/default_repo' -- Filter by repo path
```

## Query DB models via Python
```python
from mage_ai.orchestration.db import db_connection
from mage_ai.orchestration.db.models.schedules import PipelineSchedule
from mage_ai.data_preparation.models.triggers import ScheduleStatus

db_connection.start_session()

pipeline_schedules = PipelineSchedule.query.filter(
    # Filter by pipeline uuid
    PipelineSchedule.pipeline_uuid == 'example_pipeline',
    # Filter by trigger name
    PipelineSchedule.name == 'trigger_name',
)

# Get pipeline schedule count
print(f'Number of triggers: {pipeline_schedules.count()}')

# Print the detailed info
print([p.to_dict() for p in pipeline_schedules.all()])

# Update trigger status
for p in pipeline_schedules:
    p.update(status=ScheduleStatus.ACTIVE)

# Delete triggers
for p in pipeline_schedules:
    p.delete()
```
