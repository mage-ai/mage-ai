You can enable or disable the features below in your project's Preferences page,
found at `/settings/workspace/preferences`.

## Features

### Add new block v2

An improved experience for adding new blocks to your pipeline in the
Pipeline Editor (`/pipelines/[pipeline_uuid]/edit`), which allows you to
search for existing block files and use data integration blocks inside of
a standard (batch) pipeline.

### Command center

Refer to this [page](/developer-ux/command-center/spellcaster) for details on
the Command Center.

### Compute management (beta)

Adds a `Compute management` tab to the navigation pane that allows you to
configure Spark using a standalone cluster or AWS EMR.

### Custom design

Allows you to change the header logo. Refer to this [page](/platform/designs/setup)
for more details and instructions.

### Data integration in batch pipeline

This requires the `Add new block v2` feature above to be enabled as well. It allows
you to add data integration blocks (as a data loader or data exporter block) inside
of a standard (batch) pipeline, which lets you load data from different sources
or export data to different destinations. This allows more flexibility inside of a
batch pipeline, instead of using a data integration pipeline.

The data integration blocks can be found in the `All blocks -> Data loader -> Sources`
and `All blocks -> Data exporter -> Destinations` flyout menus in the Pipeline Editor.

### Dbt v2

An improved experience for adding dbt models from your files and configuring/running
your dbt blocks in the Pipeline Editor (`/pipelines/[pipeline_uuid]/edit`).

### Global hooks (beta)

An advanced feature that adds a `Global hooks` tab to the navigation pane, allowing you
to create hooks attached to an operation (e.g. create, update, delete) on some resource
(e.g. Pipeline, Pipeline Run, Block Run) that execute an associated pipeline when a
certain condition is met.

### Interactions

Refer to this [page](/interactions/overview) for details on block interactions.

### Display local timezone

Refer to this [page](/development/project/local-timezone) for more details on displaying timestamps in your local timezone.

### Notebook block output split view

Allows you to show the block output to the right of a code block (instead of below it)
in the Pipeline Editor. You can choose where to display the block output by clicking `View`
in the subheader and selecting "Show output next to code" or "Show output below block".

### Operation history

Keeps track of recently viewed pipelines so you can easily navigate back to them
in the Pipelines Dashboard (`/pipelines`). Adds a `RECENTLY VIEWED` tab to the Pipelines
Dashboard that lists these pipelines.
