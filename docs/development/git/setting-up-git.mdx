## Choose your adventure

There three different ways to use Git in Mage and _four_ ways to version control your files— we'll discussing each of them. We note that our methods for using Git are mutually exclusive.

If you're simply looking for version control, you're in luck! It ships out-of-the-box with Mage. That means you can _always_ restore previous versions of your files, even if you haven't configured any version control system. Check out [this page](/getting-started/file-versions) for more info.

Git Sync is particularly useful in production instances, where other Git methods can be used more meaningfully in development instances. Since Git sync is a one-way sync, it's not very useful for collaboration, since changes get overridden. However, this makes it great for a production Mage instance, where verified changes should only be accepted from development environments.

A common pattern is to use development instances to edit and push (Git integration), then have production instances use Git Sync or CI/CD.
