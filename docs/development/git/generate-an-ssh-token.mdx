<Steps>
   <Step title="Check for existing SSH key">
      Follow GitHub's guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys) to check for an existing SSH key.
   </Step>
   <Step title="Generate a new SSH key">
      If no key exists, generate a new key using this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
      
      You may skip this step if you already have a key.
   </Step>
   <Step title="Add SSH key to your Git provider">

      This step allows your Git provider to recognize your SSH key and communicate.

      - [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
      - [GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html#add-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account)                                     


   </Step>
   <Step title="Test your SSH connection">
      - [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection)
      - [GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html#verify-that-you-can-connect)      

   </Step>
   <Step title="Add SSH to known hosts">
      
      The first time you connect using your Git provider, you'll get a message about verifying authenticity and adding the provider to your known hosts.
      For example:

      ```txt
      The authenticity of host 'gitlab.example.com (35.231.145.151)' can't be established.
      ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:HbW3g8zUjNSksFbqTiUWPWg2Bq1x8xdGUrliXFzSnUw.
      Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
      Warning: Permanently added 'gitlab.example.com' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
      ```

      This is normal and expected. Type `yes` and press enter to continue.
