## Back up application data or files before upgrading 

Mage has built-in file versioning capabilities that can help you back up your application data or files before upgrading. This feature automatically keeps track of previous versions of a file, allowing you to roll back changes or recover old file versions without the need for manual Git configuration.

## Configure the number of versions per file

In Mage version `>=0.9.58`, you can set how many previous versions to keep track of for every file by setting the following environment variable. The default is `100`, and it's located in the `[project_name]/.file_versions`. For example, if your project name is `demo_project`, the directory will be `demo_project/.file_versions`.

By utilizing these file versioning features, you can effectively back up your application data or files before upgrading. This allows you to easily revert changes if needed during the upgrade process.
