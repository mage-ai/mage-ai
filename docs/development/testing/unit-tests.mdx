## Create unit tests and run tests in CI/CD pipeline

You can create a `tests` folder in your project folder and put unit tests in this folder.

In your CI/CD pipeline, you can `cd` into the project's folder and run the following command
to run unit tests.
```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests --failfast
```

## Example unit tests

End-to-end test for a pipeline:

```python
from mage_ai.data_preparation.models.pipeline import Pipeline
from mage_ai.tests.base_test import TestCase


class ExamplePipelineTest(TestCase):
    def test_pipeline_execution(self):
        pipeline = Pipeline.get('example_pipeline')
        pipeline.execute_sync()
```

## Test environment
When running unit tests, the `env` variable's value in the method's `kwargs` is `test`.
You can leverage this variable to change the code logic or config used in the unit tests.
