## Using Docker

### Download credentials from GCP UI

1. Download the credentials JSON file from GCP.
1. Run Mage and mount the secrets as a volume in Docker.
Follow these [instructions](/getting-started/setup#using-secret-credential-files-in-docker) to learn how to do this.
1. Here are example code snippets to read from that credentials JSON file:

        <CodeGroup>
        ```python Python
        with open('/home/secrets/gcp_credentials.json', 'r') as f:
            print(f.read())
        ```

        ```yaml YAML
        demo:
        target: prod
        outputs:
          prod_bigquery:
            dataset: mage_demo
            keyfile: /home/secrets/gcp_credentials.json
            method: service-account
            project: my_cool_gcp_project
            threads: 1
            type: bigquery
        ```

        </CodeGroup>

        > Note
        >
        > This code example assumes your credentials JSON file downloaded from GCP is named
        > `gcp_credentials.json` and that the mount path (e.g. `-v`) you used when running Docker
        > is `/home/secrets`.

### Download credentials using `gcloud` CLI

1. Authenticate locally by running this command in your local terminal:
    ```
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```
1. Create a new `.env` file in your Mage project folder with the following values:
    ```
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[PATH TO YOUR USER CREDENTIALS, MOST LIKELY: ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json]"
    GCS_BUCKET=[YOUR DEV BUCKET]
    GCLOUD_PROJECT=[YOUR PROJECT]
    ```
1. Run Mage using Docker and set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
Follow these [instructions](/getting-started/setup#environment-variables) to learn how to do this.
    For example, set the environment variable to:

    ```
    -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/tmp/keys/FILE_NAME.json
    ```
1. Run Mage and mount the secrets as a volume in Docker.
Follow these [instructions](/getting-started/setup#using-secret-credential-files-in-docker) to learn how to do this.
    For example:

    ```
    -v ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json:/tmp/keys/FILE_NAME.json
    ```
1. Here is an example code snippet:
    ```python
    from google.cloud import storage
    from pandas import DataFrame
    from datetime import datetime
    import pytz
    import os
    ​
    ​
    @data_exporter
    def export_data_to_google_cloud_storage(df: DataFrame, **kwargs) -> None:
    ​
        bucket_name = os.getenv('GCS_BUCKET')
    ​
        now = datetime.utcnow()
        pt = pytz.timezone("America/Los_Angeles")
        now_pst = pytz.utc.localize(now).astimezone(pt)
    ​
        object_key = f'test_file_{now_pst.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}.csv'
    ​
        storage_client = storage.Client()
        bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
        blob = bucket.blob(object_key)
    ​
        blob.upload_from_string(df.to_csv())
    ​
        print(f'df uploaded to {bucket}/{object_key}.')
    ```
