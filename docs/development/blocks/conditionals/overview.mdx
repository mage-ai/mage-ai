description: "A conditional block is associated to another block.
The conditional block will be executed before the parent block,
and will influence whether or not the parent block gets executed."

<Note>Requires version `0.8.93` or greater.</Note>

Conditional blocks are part of your pipeline but don’t run as individual steps in your pipeline
like data loader blocks, transformer blocks, etc.
However, conditional blocks are associated to other blocks within the pipeline
(e.g. data loaders, transformers, data exporters, etc).

Before those other blocks are executed,
any associated conditional blocks will be executed. If any conditional block returns False, the
parent block will not be executed, and its status will be set as `condition_failed`.

---

## Example

1. Your pipeline has the following blocks:
    1. `load_data_from_api` (data loader)
    1. `clean_column_names` (transformer)
    1. `save_data` (data exporter)

1. Then, you add the following conditional block to your pipeline:

    ```python
    @condition
    def check_if_data_exists(*args, **kwargs) -> bool:
        # some code...
    ```

1. You associate the above conditional block to the following block:

    - `clean_column_names` (transformer)

1. When you run the pipeline, it’ll execute the `load_data_from_api` (data loader) block first.
It completes, but the dataframe returned is empty.

1. Next, the pipeline will execute the conditional block and execute the function `check_if_data_exists`.
Since there is no data in the dataframe, the function returns False.

1. The `clean_column_names` transformer block is not executed, and the status is set as `condition_failed`.
The `save_data` data exporter block is also not executed, and is set as `condition_failed`.

## How to add conditionals to your pipeline

1. Create a new pipeline or open an existing pipeline.
1. Edit the pipeline.
1. On the right side of the page, click the <b>Add-ons</b> icon in the navigation.
    If you don’t see it, try expanding the right area of the page.
1. Click the button <b>Conditionals</b>.
1. Click the button <b>+ Conditional block</b>.
1. In the conditional block’s code, add a function that returns a boolean value and
   decorate it with `@condition`.

### Positional arguments

The positional arguments to the conditional block will be the same as the positional
arguments to the parent block. You can use the positional arguments to get the output
of the upstream blocks.

### Keyword arguments

Here are the keyword arguments that are available in each conditional function:

| Name | Description | Sample value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `block_uuid` | Conditional block UUID. | `'fireball_conditional'` |
| `ds` | Date string when the parent block started executing. | `'2023-12-25'` |
| `event` | A dictionary containing metadata from an event triggered pipeline. | `{}` |
| `execution_date` | Python datetime object for when the trigger run started executing. | `datetime.datetime(2023, 4, 26, 20, 28, 17, 335254, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)` |
| `execution_partition` | Partition used for the trigger run when it was executed. | `'207/20230426T202817'` |
| `hr` | Hour string when the trigger run started executing. | `'20'` |
| `pipeline_run` | Python pipeline run object associated to the current run. | `PipelineRun(id=2357, pipeline_uuid=fire_etl, execution_date=2023-04-26 20:28:17.335254+00:00)` |
| `pipeline_uuid` | UUID of the current pipeline. | `'fire_etl'` |
