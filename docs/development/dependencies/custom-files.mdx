## Importing custom Python code

When youâ€™re writing code in Mage, you can import any other Python files using this format:

```python
from [project_name].foo import bar
```

For example, if your project name is `demo_project` and you have the following folder structure:

```
demo_project/
|   pipelines/
|   utils/
|   |   helpers/
|   |   |   shared.py
|   |   |   __init__.py
|   |   __init__.py
```

You can write the following import statement to use functions in the
`demo_project/utils/helpers/shared.py` file:

```python
from demo_project.utils.helpers import shared
```
