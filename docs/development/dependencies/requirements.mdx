## Add Python packages to `requirements.txt`

At the root of your project directory, there is a file named `requirements.txt`. Open this file
and add the Python package you want installed and available throughout your entire project.

For example, if your project is named `demo_project` then the file will be located at
`demo_project/requirements.txt`.

## Example

`[project_name]/requirements.txt`

```
matplotlib
tqdm
```
