## Add Python packages to `requirements.txt`

### Location

At the root of your Mage project directory, you'll find a file named `requirements.txt`.
This file is used to specify all the Python packages that your project depends on.

### Path

At the root of your project directory, there is a file named `requirements.txt`. Open this file
and add the Python package you want installed and available throughout your entire project.

For example, if your project is named `demo_project` then the file will be located at
`demo_project/requirements.txt`.

### Adding packages

To add a package, simply open the `requirements.txt` file and list each package on a new line. You can also specify version requirements if needed.

### Example `requirements.txt`:

```
matplotlib==3.5.2
tqdm
```
In this example the `requirements.txt` file will install:

- matplotlib version 3.5.2
- tqdm

## Automatic installation

When installing Mage using Docker, Mage provides two main methods for automatically installing third-party packages at runtime.
These methods utilize the `USER_CODE_PATH` environment variable, which defines your project path (e.g. `/home/src/project_name`),
to locate your `requirements.txt` file and install the packages listed there.

<Accordion title="Using Command Line Flags">

## Using command line flags

If you installed Mage using Docker, the `USER_CODE_PATH` can be set using command line flags. You will need to add these command line flags at every run when running a new Docker container or installing a new version of Mage.

### Setting `USER_CODE_PATH` in Docker

The `USER_CODE_PATH` environment variable tells Mage where your project code is located within the Docker container. This is essential for features like automatic package installation from `requirements.txt`.

#### Docker run command

To set the `USER_CODE_PATH` when running a Mage Docker container, use the following command structure:

```Shell
docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v $(pwd):/home/src \
  -e USER_CODE_PATH=/home/src/project_name \
  mageai/mageai /app/run_app.sh mage start [project_name]
```
Let's break down this command:

- `it`: Runs the container interactively with a pseudo-TTY.
- `p 6789:6789`: Maps port 6789 from the container to your host machine.
- `v $(pwd):/home/src`: Mounts your current directory to `/home/src` in the container.
- `e USER_CODE_PATH=/home/src/project_name`: Sets the `USER_CODE_PATH` environment variable.
- `mageai/mageai`: Specifies the Mage Docker image to use.
- `/app/run_app.sh mage start [project_name]`: The command to run inside the container.

### Important Notes

1. **Persistence**: The `USER_CODE_PATH` setting is not persistent across container restarts or when installing new versions of Mage. You must include these flags each time you run a new Docker container.
2. **Project Name**: Replace `[project_name]` with your actual Mage project name in both the `USER_CODE_PATH` and the start command.
3. **Path Consistency**: Ensure that the path in `USER_CODE_PATH` matches the mount point specified in the `v` flag. In this example, we mount to `/home/src`, so the `USER_CODE_PATH` starts with `/home/src`.
4. **Working Directory**: The `$(pwd)` in the `v` flag assumes you're running the Docker command from your project's parent directory. Adjust this path if you're running from a different location.

<Accordion title="Using Dockerfile">

## Using Dockerfiles

One important aspect of configuring Mage is setting the `USER_CODE_PATH`, which tells Mage where your project code is located.
While this can be done using command-line flags when running Docker containers, it's also possible to set the `USER_CODE_PATH`
directly in your Dockerfile. This approach can be more convenient for consistent deployments and when building custom images.

```Bash
FROM mageai/mageai:latest

### Set up project-specific arguments
ARG PROJECT_NAME=[project_name]
ARG MAGE_CODE_PATH=/home/mage_code
ARG USER_CODE_PATH=${MAGE_CODE_PATH}/${PROJECT_NAME}

### Set working directory
WORKDIR ${MAGE_CODE_PATH}

### Copy project files
COPY ${PROJECT_NAME} ${PROJECT_NAME}

### Set the command to run on container startup
CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/app/run_app.sh"]
```

Breakdown of the Dockerfile:

1. `FROM mageai/mageai:latest`
    - Specifies the base image as the latest version of the official Mage AI image.
2. Project-specific arguments:

```Bash
ARG PROJECT_NAME=[project_name]
ARG MAGE_CODE_PATH=/home/mage_code
ARG USER_CODE_PATH=${MAGE_CODE_PATH}/${PROJECT_NAME}
```
- `PROJECT_NAME`: Should be replaced with your actual project name.
- `MAGE_CODE_PATH`: Sets the base path for Mage code.
- `USER_CODE_PATH`: Constructs the full path to your project, effectively setting the `USER_CODE_PATH` for Mage.
3. `WORKDIR ${MAGE_CODE_PATH}`
    - Sets the working directory inside the container to the path specified by `MAGE_CODE_PATH`.
4. `COPY ${PROJECT_NAME} ${PROJECT_NAME}`
    - Copies your project files from the host machine into the container.
5. `CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/app/run_app.sh"]`
    - Specifies the command to run when the container starts, which launches the Mage application.

To use this Dockerfile:

1. Replace `[project_name]` with your actual project name.
2. Ensure your project files are in a directory named after your project.
3. Build the Docker image using this Dockerfile.
4. Run the container to start your Mage environment.

This Dockerfile demonstrates how to set the `USER_CODE_PATH` using build arguments. By defining it this way, you ensure that Mage will
consistently know where to find your project code within the container, without needing to specify it each time you run the container.

Follow the [Repository setup](https://docs.mage.ai/production/ci-cd/local-cloud/repository-setup) documentation to deploy this
Dockerfile to fully automate the installation of third-party Python pacakges.

If you’re running Mage using pip or conda, your local machine’s environment variables are accessible within the running Mage app.

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure that the environment variable `USER_CODE_PATH` is set to your project path, using
the command line flags or the Dockerfile methods.

      Example: `/home/src/project_name`

2. Mage uses a script named `run_app.sh` to manage the application startup process.

### Installation process

When you start your Mage server:

1. The `run_app.sh` script checks the `USER_CODE_PATH` environment variable.
2. It locates the `requirements.txt` file within the specified project directory.
3. All packages listed in `requirements.txt` are automatically installed before the server starts.

This ensures that all required packages are available for your project and pipelines.
