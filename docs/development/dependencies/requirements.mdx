## Add Python packages to `requirements.txt`

At the root of your project directory, there is a file named `requirements.txt`. Open this file
and add the Python package you want installed and available throughout your entire project.

For example, if your project is named `demo_project` then the file will be located at
`demo_project/requirements.txt`.

## Example

`[project_name]/requirements.txt`

```
matplotlib
tqdm
```

## Automatic installation

To automatically install the packages in `requirements.txt`, you'll need to make sure the
environment variable `USER_CODE_PATH` is set to the value of your project path (e.g. `/home/src/project_name`).

Mage's `run_app.sh` script automatically installs the requirements.txt under the `USER_CODE_PATH` before server starts.
