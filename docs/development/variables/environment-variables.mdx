## Environment variables in Mage

Environment variables may be set in your Docker container to configure Mage settings. If you’re running Mage using `pip` or `conda`, your local machine’s environment variables
are accessible within the running Mage app.

Environment variables are different from [runtime variables](/getting-started/runtime-variable) or [secrets](/development/variables/secrets).

If you’re running Mage using Docker, you must add the following command line flags:

```bash
-e SOME_VARIABLE_NAME_1=secret_value_1 -e SOME_VARIABLE_NAME_2=secret_value_2
```

The command to run Mage using Docker could look like this:

```bash
docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v $(pwd):/home/src \
    -e SOME_VARIABLE_NAME_1=secret_value_1 -e SOME_VARIABLE_NAME_2=secret_value_2 \
    mageai/mageai /app/run_app.sh mage start [project_name]
```

## Default variables

Please see [this page](/development/variables/default-variables) for a list of all default environment variables.

## Setting the prefix for Mage URL

You may need to add a prefix to the Mage url. You can configure the Mage server to start
at a prefix to the url by setting the `MAGE_BASE_PATH` environment variable.

Make sure to set the base path without the leading slash. For example, if you want to start Mage at
`http://localhost:6789/base/url/path`, you would configure your environment
variable like this:

`export MAGE_BASE_PATH=base/url/path`

You can also configure the base path separately for client requests and backend routes by setting
the `MAGE_REQUESTS_BASE_PATH` and `MAGE_ROUTES_BASE_PATH` environment variables respectively.

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| `MAGE_BASE_PATH` | Set base path for the entire app. |
| `MAGE_REQUESTS_BASE_PATH` | Set base path for frontend requests and urls, defaults to value of `MAGE_BASE_PATH` |
| `MAGE_ROUTES_BASE_PATH` | Set base path for backend routes, defaults to value of `MAGE_BASE_PATH` |

## Using credential files in Docker

If you have files containing secret credentials (e.g. GCP credentials JSON files),
you’ll need to mount them as a volume so that those files appear in your running Docker container.

Use the `-v` command in your `docker run` command to mount the directory containing your files:

```bash
docker run -it -p 6789:6789
    -v /Users/dragon/secrets:/home/secrets \
    -v $(pwd):/home/src mageai/mageai \
    /app/run_app.sh mage start [project_name]
```

or, using `docker compose`, add a volume mount to your Mage service. The following is an example of mounting the `~/.aws` directory for authenticating via the AWS CLI:

```yaml
services:
  mage:
    image: mageai/mageai:latest
    ...
    volumes:
      - ~/.aws:/root/.aws
```
