## Pipeline edit page freezes browser

The data output of a block contains too much information for the browser to render.

To temporarily fix this, open the `/terminal` page in Mage.
Then type the following command press enter to run it:

```bash
rm -rf mage_data/[project_name]/pipelines/[pipeline_name]/.variables
```

> Note
>
> Change `[project_name]` to your Mage project name and change `[pipeline_name]` to the name of
> the pipeline that is freezing the browser.

The above command will remove the data output files for each block in your pipeline.

## Can’t connect to local database from within Mage via Docker

If you’re running Mage via Docker and you’re trying to connect to a local database outside of
Docker, you must use the following `host` or `IP` value when trying to connect to it:
`host.docker.internal`.

## Changing columns

Sometimes, we can't control what data upstream of our pipelines contains. 😔

Thankfully, [Mage Community](https://join.slack.com/t/mageai/shared_invite/zt-1adn34w4m-t~TcnPTlo3~5~d_0raOp6A) member [Josh Pachner](https://mageai.slack.com/team/U05B9DLK0N7) has a solution. 

Say you have an upstream block that looks like:

```SQL
SELECT 
  df."col_1",
  df."col_2",
  df."col_3",
FROM {{ df }} df
```

Where the underlying `df` might all three columns... or just a subset. 😅

For cases where expected columns _might_ not be present, we can add a transformer block upstream of an exporter:

```python
# headers = [cols we need in our dataframe]
# df = our DataFrame()

for head in headers:
  if head not in df.columns:
       df[head] = None
```
This is especially helpful in databases like Snowflake, which don't have an `iferror()` function to check for missing columns.
