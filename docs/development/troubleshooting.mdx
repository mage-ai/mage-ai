## Pipeline edit page freezes browser

The data output of a block contains too much information for the browser to render.

To temporarily fix this, open the `/terminal` page in Mage.
Then type the following command press enter to run it:

```bash
rm -rf mage_data/[project_name]/pipelines/[pipeline_name]/.variables
```

> Note
>
> Change `[project_name]` to your Mage project name and change `[pipeline_name]` to the name of
> the pipeline that is freezing the browser.

The above command will remove the data output files for each block in your pipeline.
