Mage uses AI to help you build data pipelines fasterâ€” with our OpenAI integration, you can automate the tedious parts of pipeline development and focus on the fun stuff.

We currently support the following AI features:

- Generate a pipeline using AI
- Generate a block using AI
- Document code using AI
  - Block documentation
  - Block comments
  - Pipeline documentation
  - Pipeline documentation _for each block_

<Note>You will need to add an OpenAI API key to your project before you can use AI for various actions.</Note>

To see examples of how to use AI in Mage, check out the [AI guides](/guides/ai/overview).
