## 1. What is an AI Block?

An **AI block** is a special type of block in a Mage pipeline that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to:

- Generate text or code
- Return structured data in a defined schema
- Trigger other pipelines as tools
- Validate outputs before passing them downstream

AI blocks are configured in **YAML** and can be designed to:

- Write and validate executable code
- Produce structured outputs for downstream blocks
- Decide which other pipelines to trigger and pass them variables

They integrate directly with Mage’s orchestration engine, allowing AI-generated outputs to be chained together, validated, and reused.

## 2. How to Use an AI Block

1. **Add a new block** in your Mage pipeline and set its type to `ai`.
2. **Write a prompt** — the main instruction for the AI.
3. **Optionally define output settings**:
   - **Code generation** (`output.code`)
   - **Structured JSON schema** (`output.format`)
4. **(Optional) Configure tools** to allow the AI to trigger other pipelines.
5. **Run the pipeline** — Mage will send your prompt and configuration to the AI model, validate the output (if specified), and pass it to the next blocks.

**Minimal example:**

```yaml
prompt: Summarize the input text in two sentences
```

## 3. AI Block Configuration

### 3.1 Basic Structure

```yaml
prompt: |
  Enter what you want AI to do
output:
  # Choose either `code` or `format`, not both
  code:
    save: true
    validation: Ensure this code runs without errors
  format:
    name:
      type: string
      description: The name of the person
    age:
      type: integer
      minimum: 0
validation: Validation prompt for output
tools:
  prompt: A prompt to decide which pipeline(s) to trigger
  required: false
  pipelines:
    - uuid: pipeline_uuid
      description: Description of the pipeline
      blocks:
        - uuid: block_uuid
      variables:
        user_id:
          type: string
```

---

### 3.2 Fields

#### **prompt** (Required)

The instruction to send to the AI model.

- Supports multi-line strings with `|`.
- Example:

```yaml
prompt: |
  Write a haiku about the moon.
```

#### **output**

Controls how the AI’s response is validated and structured.

1. **Code Output**

```yaml
output:
  code:
    save: true # Save generated code for reuse
    validation: Ensure no syntax errors
    language: sql # Optional, e.g., python or sql
    profile: default # SQL connection profile from io_config.yaml
    client: postgres # SQL client type
```

2. **Structured Format Output**

```yaml
output:
  format:
    title:
      type: string
      description: Blog post title
    tags:
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
    published:
      type: boolean
  validation: Ensure all fields are present and valid
```

3. **Unstructured Output**

```yaml
output: ''
```

---

#### **tools**

Lets the AI trigger other pipelines as part of execution.

```yaml
tools:
  prompt: Select a pipeline to process this request
  required: true
  pipelines:
    - uuid: abc123
      description: Cleans and normalizes customer data
      blocks:
        - uuid: block_1
      variables:
        customer_id:
          type: string
```

---

## 4. JSON Schema Support for Structured Outputs

The `output.format` and `variables` fields use **JSON Schema draft-07** (subset) to define:

- `type` — string, number, integer, boolean, array, object
- `description` — field description
- `enum` — allowed values
- `items` — item schema for arrays
- `minItems`, `maxItems` — constraints for arrays
- `pattern` — regex validation for strings
- `required` — list of required keys
- `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf` — branching validation
- `$ref`, `$defs` — recursive or modular schemas

**Example:**

```yaml
output:
  format:
    email:
      type: string
      format: email
    signup_date:
      type: string
      format: date-time
```

---

## 5. Best Practices

- Use **`output.code`** only when expecting executable code.
- Use **`output.format`** for predictable structured outputs.
- Avoid defining both `code` and `format` in the same block.
- Use **multi-line prompts** with `|` for readability.
- Only include fields you need — minimal configs run faster.
- Always include a `validation` prompt for critical outputs.
- When chaining pipelines, define `variables` clearly for tool execution.

## 6. Example Configurations

**Minimal AI Block**

```yaml
prompt: Summarize this document in bullet points
```

**AI Block with Structured Output**

```yaml
prompt: Extract customer details from the text
output:
  format:
    name:
      type: string
      description: Customer's full name
    email:
      type: string
      format: email
    phone:
      type: string
      pattern: "^[0-9\\-]+$"
  validation: Ensure all fields are filled
```

**AI Block Triggering Another Pipeline**

```yaml
prompt: Analyze sales data and decide next action
tools:
  prompt: Choose a data processing pipeline
  required: true
  pipelines:
    - uuid: sales_analysis_001
      description: Processes daily sales data
      blocks:
        - uuid: clean_data_block
      variables:
        date:
          type: string
          format: date
```
