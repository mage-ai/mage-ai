## Design Complex Data Pipelines in Seconds

Stop wasting hours piecing together pipelines by hand. Mage Pro AI can design and build complex data workflows in seconds. Just describe your goal in plain English, and Mage Pro AI auto-generates the full pipeline—every block, every dependency, every line of code.

<div style={{
  position: 'relative',
  width: '100%',
  paddingBottom: '56.25%', /* 16:9 ratio */
  height: 0,
  overflow: 'hidden',
  borderRadius: '12px',
  boxShadow: '0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)'
}}>

    title="Design Complex Data Pipelines in Seconds"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%',
      border: 0,
      borderRadius: '12px'
    }}
  />
</div>

### How it works

Tell Mage Pro AI what you want to build—ingest from S3, transform with Polars, join with a Delta Lake table, run daily, alert on failure. Mage instantly maps out the entire pipeline and generates working code for each step, fully integrated with your existing tools and infrastructure.

### Why it matters

Manually building pipelines is slow, error-prone, and often blocks teams from experimenting or scaling quickly. Mage Pro AI turns hours of setup into seconds of generation—so engineers can focus on what matters: logic, not boilerplate.

## AI-Generated Code Blocks for Data Pipelines

Design your pipeline one step at a time—without writing a single line of code. Mage Pro AI can generate complete, production-ready code blocks for every stage of your data workflow.

<div style={{
  position: 'relative',
  width: '100%',
  paddingBottom: '56.25%', /* 16:9 ratio */
  height: 0,
  overflow: 'hidden',
  borderRadius: '12px',
  boxShadow: '0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)'

      width: '100%',
      height: '100%',
      border: 0,
      borderRadius: '12px'
    }}
  />
</div>

### How it works

Tell Mage what you need:  
> “Load this CSV from S3,”  
> “Join with this Delta Lake table,”  
> “Clean nulls in this column,”  
> “Calculate weekly aggregates.”

### Why it matters

Writing every block by hand is slow and repetitive. Mage Pro AI speeds up development by giving you smart, reusable code blocks that integrate cleanly with upstream and downstream steps.

Mage Pro AI creates interactive tables with sorting, filtering, and searching automatically after your pipeline runs—no front-end or dashboard setup needed.

### Why it matters

Don’t stop at raw output. Instantly turn your data into interactive, insightful products for analysts, stakeholders, or pipelines.



## Enable RAG

**Empower Mage Pro AI to give smarter, context-aware answers by enabling RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).**

When RAG is enabled, Mage Pro AI can reference your actual project files — including pipeline code, configurations, and documentation — to provide deeper, more accurate answers. This dramatically improves the AI’s ability to help with debugging, code generation, and pipeline understanding.

### Why Enable RAG

Without RAG, Mage Pro AI answers based solely on general knowledge and standard behaviors. With RAG enabled:

- ✅ The AI can **reference your exact project structure and code**
- ✅ Responses are **context-specific** and align with your real pipelines
- ✅ You get **accurate fixes, relevant suggestions, and smarter debugging**
- ✅ Answers reflect your own naming conventions, tools, and logic

If RAG is not enabled, the AI will ask for permission before reading any of your files each time you make a request.

### How to Enable RAG

Create a file at the root of your project named `ai_config.yaml`. This file defines which folders the AI is allowed to read and which files to exclude.

#### Option 1: Enable RAG for the entire project


Create a file at the root of your project named `ai_config.yaml`

```yaml
rag:
  folders:
    include:
      - /home/src/default_repo
  files:
    exclude:
      # gitignore patterns
      - secrets.json
# Add this if you permit the AI to read your data when asking it questions.
# If this is not present, then the AI will ask for your permission each time.
data:
  all: true
```

#### Option 2: Enable RAG for selected folders only


```yaml
rag:
  folders:
    include:
      - /home/projects/mage-pro-tutorials/callbacks
      - /home/projects/mage-pro-tutorials/conditionals
      - /home/projects/mage-pro-tutorials/custom
      - /home/projects/mage-pro-tutorials/data_exporters
      - /home/projects/mage-pro-tutorials/data_loaders
      - /home/projects/mage-pro-tutorials/dbt
      - /home/projects/mage-pro-tutorials/extensions
      - /home/projects/mage-pro-tutorials/sensors
      - /home/projects/mage-pro-tutorials/transformers
      - /home/projects/mage-pro-tutorials/services
      - /home/projects/mage-pro-tutorials/utils
  files:
    exclude:
      # gitignore patterns
      - .env
```

### How to Trigger Reindexing

Once you've updated your `ai_config.yaml`, call the following API to reindex your project files into the vector store:


```python
import requests

url = "https://cluster.mage.ai/[cluster UUID]/api/vector_store"

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer IwMQiEhGerIOt2DxJNiCwOlSiRigpda2FM4mTfjphq8",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
}

payload = {
    "vector_store": {
        "path": "/home/src/default_repo",
    },
    "api_key": "[API key]",
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
```

After reindexing, Mage Pro AI will be able to answer questions using your real project data—enabling more personalized, precise assistance.
