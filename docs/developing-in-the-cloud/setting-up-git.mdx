1. Open terminal
2. Configure Git
3. Set up SSH key
4. Add SSH key to GitHub profiles settings
5. Add github.com to known hosts

## 1. Open terminal

1. Open a pipeline
2. In the right panel of the screen (aka Sidekick), click on the tab named
   **Terminal**.
3. Click the terminal (large dark background area), and you should see a
   blinking cursor. You can start typing once that cursor appears.

## 2. Configure Git

1. In the terminal, type the following command to set your user name:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your name here"
   ```
2. In the terminal, type the following command to set your email:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   ```

Optionally, you can configure Git further with these commands:

```bash
git config --global color.ui true
git config --global core.editor emacs
```

## 3. Set up SSH key

1. In the terminal, type the following command to create an SSH key on the
   machine that’s running Mage:
   ```
   bash ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""
   ```

   If you get the error `cannot execute binary file`, then re-run the command above without `bash`:
   ```
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""
   ```
2. Run the following command and copy the public SSH key (it’ll be used

   <ins></ins> the next section):{" "}

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

   It should look something like this:

   ```
   ssh-rsa alotofcharacters...morecharacters your_email@example.com
   ```

   open a new form to create a new SSH key.
4. Enter in anything into the input field labeled **Title**. For example,
   `mage-cloud-key`.
5. Under the dropdown labeled **Key type**, select the `Authentication Key`
   option.
6. In the text area labeled **Key**, paste in the output text you copied after
   running the command `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` in your terminal.
7. Click the button labeled **Add SSH key**.
