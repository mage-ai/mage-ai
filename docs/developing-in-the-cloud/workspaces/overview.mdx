We recommend running your production environment in the cloud. Mage has a built in
workspace manager that can be enabled in production. This feature is similar to the
[multi-development environments](/developing-in-the-cloud/cloud-dev-environments/overview), but
there are settings that can be shared across the workspaces. For example, the project owner
can set workspace level permissions for users. The current additional features supported are:

* workspace level permissions
* workspace level git settings

still to come...

* common workspace metadata file
* project level permissions
* customizable permissions and roles

### Setup

In order to start using workspace management, you will first need to create a "main project". The
main project is the parent project that will handle the management of all the workspaces. To create
a main project, you will need to set the following environment variable:

`export PROJECT_TYPE="main"`

If you want to use workspace level permissions, you will also need to enable user authentication
and [provide an external database](/production/configuring-production-settings/overview#databases)
(not the default SQLite DB) that will be shared among your workspaces. To enable user authentication,
you will need to set the following environment variable:

`export REQUIRE_USER_AUTHENTICATION="1"`

Depending on your cloud environment, Mage may expect additional environment variables.

### Cloud environments

Mage currently natively supports creating workspaces in these cloud providers:

* [Kubernetes](/developing-in-the-cloud/workspaces/kubernetes)

still to come...

* Amazon ECS
* Google Cloud Run
