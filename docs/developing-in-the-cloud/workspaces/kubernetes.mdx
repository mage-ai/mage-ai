### Setup

We recommend using Helm to set up your Kubernetes cluster. You can find our Mage Helm
documentation [here](/production/deploying-to-cloud/using-helm). You will need to create
a persistent volume for your cluster

You will need to include your Kubernetes namespace as an environment variable when setting
up your Kubernetes deployment. Here is a sample config for the `values.yaml` file for the
Helm chart:

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: mage-fs
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: gke-mage-pvc


env:
  - name: KUBE_NAMESPACE
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: metadata.namespace
  - name: PROJECT_TYPE
    value: main
  - name: MAGE_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL
    value: <database_connection_url>
  - name: REQUIRE_USER_AUTHENTICATION
    value: "1"
```

### Permissions

Once your cluster and initial deployment is created, you will also need to give your
Kubernetes service account some permissions in order to create the necessary resources.
You can run the folliwng `kubectl` command to create the `ClusterRole` required for 
managing the Kubernetes resources.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: manage-role
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ""
      - apps
    resources:
      - services
      - statefulsets
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
EOF
```

Once the cluster role is created, you will need to bind the role to the 
service account. You will need to change the service account name if it is not `default`:

```bash
kubectl create clusterrolebinding manage-role-binding \
  --clusterrole=manage-role  \
  --serviceaccount=default:default
```

### Usage

Once you start Mage and log in, you should land on the workspaces dashboard (/manage).

To create a new workspace, you can press the "Create new workspace" button in the top left. A modal
should appear where you can configure some workspace settings.

Here are the fields you can currently customize through the Mage UI for Kubernetes.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `PROJECT_TYPE` |
| Value | `main` | `1` |
