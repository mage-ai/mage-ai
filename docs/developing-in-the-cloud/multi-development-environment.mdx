We recommend running your development environment and production environment in
the cloud. Use Mage's maintained [Terraform scripts](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates)
to deploy to cloud.

You can manage your cloud development environment with Mage. Each developer on
your team can have access to their own Mage server with a unique IP.

Each developer's environment will run on cloud resources but won't impact other
developers' environments or their code. The code each developer writes is stored
under a separate directory that won't conflict with other developers' code.

Your team can use [Git for version control](/developing-in-the-cloud/setting-up-git) in the cloud.
