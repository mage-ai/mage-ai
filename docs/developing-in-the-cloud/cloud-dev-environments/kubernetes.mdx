## Google Kubernetes Engine

### Pre-requisites

You need to already have a Kubernetes cluster with a namespace running.

#### Permissions

In order for Mage to create the dev resources, the namespace service account
needs to have certain permissions. To create the `ClusterRole` required for the
service account, you can run the following `kubectl` command:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: manage-role
rules:
  - apiGroups:
        - ""
        - apps
    resources:
      - services
      - statefulsets
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
EOF
```

Once the cluster role is created, you will need to bind the role to the 
service account. You will need to change the service account name if it is
different:

```bash
kubectl create clusterrolebinding manage-role-binding \
  --clusterrole=manage-role  \
  --serviceaccount=default:default
```

#### PostgreSQL Database

By default, Mage will use a SQLite database for each dev environment. SQLite
does not perform well in the cloud, so we recommend using a Postgres database
instead.

To connect to a Cloud SQL PostgreSQL database from your GKE workload, you'll 
need to follow these steps. These steps can be found in the
[official Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/connect-kubernetes-engine)

* [Create your DB secrets](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/connect-kubernetes-engine#create_a_secret_object)
* [Create your service account secrets](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/connect-kubernetes-engine#service-account-key-file)
  * Make sure to record the path of the service account credential file. 

You'll need to add the names of the secrets you created above as environment variables when
creating your manager workload.

### Configuring the manager workload

Currently, you will need to create the manager workload on your own. You can create
a `Deployment` workload with the following environment variables:

| Variable Name                        | Value                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MANAGE_INSTANCE                      | 1                                                                                                  |
| KUBE_NAMESPACE                       | Your Kubernetes namespace                                                                          |
| KUBE_SERVICE_TYPE                    | Service type for Kubernetes Service (default = 'LoadBalancer')                                     |
| KUBE_SERVICE_GCP_BACKEND_CONFIG      | Identifier for GCP Service backend config annotation: 'cloud.google.com/backend-config' (optional) |
| KUBE_STORAGE_CLASS_NAME              | Kubernetes storage class name for stateful set storage (optional, uses cluster default if empty)   |
| CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME            | Cloud SQL instance connection name (required for PostgreSQL DB)                                    |
| CONNECTION_URL_SECRETS_NAME          | Connection url secrets name (required for PostgreSQL DB if DB_SECRETS_NAME is empty)               |
| DB_SECRETS_NAME                      | DB secrets name (required for PostgreSQL DB if CONNECTION_URL_SECRETS_NAME is empty)               |
| SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRETS_NAME         | Service account secrets name (required for PostgreSQL DB)                                          |
| SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIAL_FILE_PATH | Credentials file path in previous step (required for PostgreSQL DB)                                |

You can also create a service to create an ip address to access the deployment. You will
need your service to point to port 6789 in order to access Mage.

### Creating instances

Once the manager workload is created, you can create your development instances. If all the
prerequisites were completed successfully, you should be able to simply enter a name for the
StatefulSet workload, and press the `Create` button.
