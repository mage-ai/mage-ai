## Prerequisites

Before using Athena in Mage, make sure you have the following:

- ✅ An **S3 bucket** to store Athena query results (this is required by Athena)
- ✅ A **DynamoDB table** if using Athena’s table versioning (optional but recommended for Glue-backed catalogs)
- ✅ A **database and table** defined in Athena (via AWS Glue, or manually in the Athena console)
- ✅ An **IAM user or role** with the following permissions:
  - `athena:StartQueryExecution`
  - `athena:GetQueryExecution`
  - `athena:GetQueryResults`
  - `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject`, `s3:ListBucket` (for the staging S3 bucket)
- ✅ The [`pyathena`](https://pypi.org/project/pyathena/) Python package installed


## Using Python block

1. Create a new pipeline or open an existing pipeline.
2. Add a data loader or transformer block (the code snippet below is for a data loader).
3. Select `Generic (no template)`.
4. Enter the following code snippet using `pyathena`:

   ```python
   from pyathena import connect
   import pandas as pd

   if 'data_loader' not in globals():
       from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import data_loader

   @data_loader
   def load_from_athena(**kwargs) -> pd.DataFrame:
       conn = connect(
           aws_access_key_id='your-access-key',
           aws_secret_access_key='your-secret-key',
           region_name='us-west-2',
           s3_staging_dir='s3://your-athena-query-results/'
       )

       query = 'SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 100'
       df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
       return df
    ```
5. Run the block.

## Install dependencies

Before running the code, install the required Python package:

```bash
pip install pyathena
```

## Common errors

### ❌ Missing or invalid staging directory
Athena requires a staging location in S3 to store temporary query results.

Make sure `s3_staging_dir` is:
- A valid S3 URI (e.g. `s3://your-bucket/path/`)
- Located in the **same region** as your Athena workgroup
- Writable by the credentials you're using

### ❌ Access Denied
If you see access-related errors:
- Verify your AWS access key and secret are correct
- Confirm that your IAM user or role has permissions for both Athena and S3
- Check the S3 bucket policy to ensure it allows access from your IAM identity

### ❌ Region mismatch
Make sure all resources are in the same region:
- Athena workgroup
- S3 staging bucket
- AWS region specified in your connection config (e.g. `region_name='us-west-2'`)

Using mismatched regions can result in silent failures or confusing errors.
