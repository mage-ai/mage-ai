## Configuration

To configure Google Sheets with Mage, you'll need to enable several APIs in your GCP project and add credentials to Mage.

### Enable relevant APIs

Using Google Sheets in Mage requires the following to be enabled via GCP:

- Google Drive API
- Google Sheets API

Additionaly, the Google Sheet must be shared with the service account used in Mage. 

You can follow [this guide](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/oauth2.html) to enable relevant services.

### Add credentials

Adding credentials for Sheets is the same as adding credentials for other Google services, i.e. BigQuery, GCP.

## Usage

We have two templates for using Google Sheets with Mage. They can be found in Python "Data Loader" and "Data Exporter" templates.

You can see the source code for the templates [here](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/blob/master/mage_ai/data_preparation/templates/data_exporters/google_sheets.py) and [here](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/blob/master/mage_ai/data_preparation/templates/data_loaders/google_sheets.py).
