## Add credentials

To access **Apache Iceberg tables stored in Amazon S3**, you'll need to configure your credentials.

1. Create a new pipeline or open an existing pipeline.
2. Expand the left side of your screen to view the file browser.
3. Scroll down and click on a file named `io_config.yaml`.
4. Enter the following keys and values under the key named `default` (or the profile you are using):

   ```yaml
   version: 0.1.1
   default:
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ...
     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ...
     AWS_REGION: us-west-2  # or the region where your S3 bucket is located
   ```
   > These credentials must have read/write access to the S3 bucket that contains your Iceberg tables.

## Using Python block
You can use Mage to load data from Iceberg tables stored in S3 or export data to Iceberg tables using a configurable Python block.

**Steps**
1. **Create or open a pipeline** in your Mage Pro cluster.
2. **Add a block** of type **Data Loader** or **Data Exporter**.
3. From the block template list, choose:  
   **Data lakes â†’ Apache Iceberg**
4. In the generated code block, update the following required configuration parameters:
   - `base_uri`: The URI of your data lake storage (e.g., `s3://your-bucket-name/warehouse`)
   - `bucket_name`: Name of your S3 bucket
   - `table_name`: Fully qualified name of your Iceberg table (e.g., `db_name.table_name`)
5. If you're using a non-default profile, update the `config_profile` field accordingly.
6. **Run the block** to load or export data from your Iceberg table stored on S3.


### Notes
- The Iceberg integration supports direct access to tables through metadata stored in S3.  
- Make sure the `table_path` points to the root directory of the Iceberg table (i.e., where the `metadata/` folder resides).  
- Mage uses a **Postgres-backed Iceberg catalog** by default. If you're using a different catalog (e.g., **Hive** or **REST**), you can customize the configuration to point to your specific catalog endpoint and type.
