## Configuration

Here are the following keyword arguments that can be used for configuration:

| Keyword argument | Description | Sample value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `access_token` | [Stitch API acess token](https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/developers/stitch-connect/api#obtain-access-token) | `abc123` |

## Example code

Trigger sync with `source_id`.
```python
from mage_ai.services.stitch.stitch import StitchClient


client = StitchClient(config=dict(access_token='access_token'))

sources = client.list_sources()
source_id = sources[0]['id'] # Get source id

client.start_replication_job(source_id) # Start replication job
```

Sample output:

```
Start replication job for source 11111. Job name: 111111.222222.sync.abcd1234-a96e-4b48-a10c-9de147a72d64.
