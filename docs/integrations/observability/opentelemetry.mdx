## Overview

This guide details how to monitor your `mage_ai` application using OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry provides a unified approach to collecting telemetry data, such as traces and metrics, which are essential for understanding your application's performance and behavior.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following prerequisites are in place before proceeding:
- An OpenTelemetry Collector is set up and configured to receive telemetry data.
- The `mage_ai` application is ready for instrumentation with OpenTelemetry.

## Configuring OpenTelemetry in `mage_ai`

### Setting Environment Variables

Configure the OpenTelemetry Exporters in your application by setting the following environment variables:

1. **OTLP HTTP Exporter**:
   Use `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT` to specify the HTTP endpoint of your OpenTelemetry Collector.

   Example:
   ```bash
   export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT="http://192.168.1.56:3418/v1/traces"
   ```

2. **OTLP Exporter**:

The OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT environment variable sets a general collector endpoint, which can be used for both gRPC and HTTP connections.

Example:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="192.168.1.56:3417"
```

### Instrumentation in the Application

1. **SQLAlchemy Instrumentation**:
The application uses the SQLAlchemyInstrumentor from OpenTelemetry to instrument database operations. This generates telemetry data like traces for database interactions.

2. **Tornado Instrumentation**:
To monitor HTTP server operations, the application integrates OpenTelemetry's Tornado instrumentation. This collects valuable data related to HTTP requests and server performance.

## Telemetry Data Collection and Analysis

With the environment variables set and the application running, OpenTelemetry will start collecting telemetry data based on the defined instrumentation.

1. **Data Collection**:
The application will send the collected telemetry data, including traces and metrics, to the specified OpenTelemetry Collector endpoint.

2. **Analyzing Telemetry Data**:
For effective visualization and analysis, you can connect your OpenTelemetry Collector to backend tools that support OpenTelemetry data (like Grafana or Jaeger).
