## Enable Prometheus

You will need to add `ENABLE_PROMETHEUS` environment variable as `true` in order to
enable Prometheus style metrics on the \<BASE_PATH\>/metrics route.

## Prometheus metrics

When enabled, Mage will publish Metrics for the HTTP Server (Tornado) as well as for
the Python Runtime. The /metrics route will be updated on-demand to respond to scrape requests.
