## Setup Docker enviroment

To effectively connect on a StrongDM Resource inside Mage's docker, you may need to add:
<br/>
    If using docker run command:
    <br/>
        ``` --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway ```
        <br/>
    If using docker-compose setup:
    <br/>
        ```yaml
        services:
            server:
                .....
                extra_hosts:
                    - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
        ```

## Install StrongDM CLI tool

To install StrongDM CLI tool, first access Mage's docker bash and execute the installation script:
```bash
./scripts/strongdm/install.sh
```
(In case you receive a "Permission denied" error, executing ```
chmod u+x scripts/strongdm/install.sh ``` should fix this issue)

Now, login in your StrongDM account using:
```bash
sdm login
```

And connect to the desired Resources using:
```bash
sdm connect RESOURCE-NAME
```

## Accessing StrongDM Resources

Now, to connect to a Resource, simply add the required host parameter as "localhost" and the respective port number

MongoDB Source example:

```yaml
database: admin
host: localhost
password: example
port: 10006 # Specified in StrongDM Resource Generation
user: root
```
