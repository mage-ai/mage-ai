## Overview

**Syncing external data → internal systems**

If you have data in 3rd party systems (e.g other SaaS tools) and you want that
data available in your database, data warehouse, or data lake, you can use Mage
to sync data between those systems.

<b>Syncing internal data → external systems (reverse)</b>

Your internal database or data warehouse may contain application data generated
by your users or customers. This data can be valuable if used in conjunction
with 3rd party SaaS tools.

You can use Mage to sync data from your internal systems, and have that data
appear in various 3rd party SaaS tools.

## Sources

A source is a system that you want to load data from and synchronize it into
another system. A source can be a 3rd party API, SaaS, database, data warehouse,
or a data lake.

Mage adheres to the data engineering standard for data integrations called the
[Singer Spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/SPEC.md).

All sources (aka taps) that has been developed by the open-source community can
be adapted to use in Mage. Here is a
[short list of available ones](https://www.singer.io/#taps).
