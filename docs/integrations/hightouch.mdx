## Example code

Trigger sync with `sync_id`.
```python
from mage_ai.services.hightouch.hightouch import HightouchClient


client = HightouchClient(config=dict(api_key='api_key'))
syncs = client.list_syncs()      # Get all the syncs
sync_id = syncs['data'][0]['id'] # Get sync id
client.sync_and_poll(sync_id)    # Trigger sync and poll status
```

Sample output:

```
Polling Hightouch Sync [id]. Current status: querying. 0% completed.
Polling Hightouch Sync [id]. Current status: success. 100% completed.
Sync request status: success. Polling complete
```
