## Setup

If you haven’t setup a project before, check out the
[setup guide](/tutorials/quick_start/setup.md) before starting.

---

## Pipelines

<sub>`http://localhost:3000/pipelines`</sub>

This page will show all the pipelines in your project.

> Core abstraction: [Pipeline](/introduction/core-abstractions#pipeline)
>
> A pipeline contains references to all the blocks of code you want to run,
> charts for visualizing data, and organizes the dependency between each block
> of code.

Learn more about
[**projects and pipelines here**](/introduction/core-abstractions#project).

From this page, you can also create a new pipeline by clicking the

**`[+ New pipeline]`** button.

#### Creating new pipeline

Creating a new pipeline will take you to the **Pipeline edit page**; a
notebook-like experience for adding blocks, creating dependencies between
blocks, testing code, and visualizing data with charts.

## Pipeline runs

<sub>
  [`http://localhost:3000/pipeline-runs`](http://localhost:3000/pipeline-runs)
</sub>

View all the runs for every pipeline in your current project.

> Core abstraction: [Run](/introduction/core-abstractions#run)
>
> A run record stores information about when it was started, its status, when it
> was completed, any runtime variables used in the execution of the pipeline or
> block, etc.

## Pipeline detail

<sub>`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/[uuid]`</sub>

This page contains all the information and history for a single pipeline:

1. [Triggers](/introduction/core-abstractions#trigger)
1. [Runs](/introduction/core-abstractions#run)
1. [Logs](/introduction/core-abstractions#log)

## Triggers

<sub>
  [`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/triggers`](http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/triggers)
</sub>

This page shows all the active and inactive triggers for a single pipeline.

> Core abstraction: [Trigger](/introduction/core-abstractions#trigger)
>
> A trigger is a set of instructions that determine when or how a pipeline
> should run.

#### Create trigger

<sub>`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/[uuid]/triggers/[id]/edit`</sub>

Create a new trigger for this pipeline by clicking the **`[+ Create]`** button
near the top of the page.

You can configure the trigger to run the pipeline on a schedule or when an event
occurs.

> Core abstraction: [Schedule](/introduction/core-abstractions#schedule)
>
> A schedule type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run after a start date
> and on a set interval.

---

> Core abstraction: [Event](/introduction/core-abstractions#event)
>
> An event type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run whenever a specific
> event occurs.

<sub>

</sub>

---

#### Trigger detail

On this page, you can start or pause the trigger. Starting the trigger will make
it active. Pausing the trigger will prevent it from running the pipeline.

<Note>
  If you have other triggers for this pipeline, pausing 1 trigger may not stop
  the pipeline from running since other triggers can also run the pipeline.
</Note>

You can also edit the trigger after creating it by clicking the

**`[Edit trigger]`** button.

## Runs

<sub>
  [`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/runs`](http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/runs)
</sub>

View the pipeline runs and block runs for a pipeline.

> Core abstraction: [Run](/introduction/core-abstractions#run)
>
> A run record stores information about when it was started, its status, when it
> was completed, any runtime variables used in the execution of the pipeline or
> block, etc.

## Logs

<sub>
  [`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/logs`](http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/logs)
</sub>

Browse all logs for a pipeline. You can search and filter logs by log level,
block type, block UUID, and more.

> Core abstraction: [**Log**](/introduction/core-abstractions#log)
>
> A log is a file that contains system output information.

## Monitor

You can monitor many metrics for each of your pipelines and blocks. Soon, you’ll
be able to monitor aggregate metrics across all pipelines and blocks.
