<Note>If you're familiar with Docker Compose or plan on adding or extending images (e.g. Postgres) in your project, we recommend starting from the compose template. Otherwise, we recommend Docker run.</Note>

<Accordion title="Docker compose template" icon="Docker">

The following is useful if you plan on customizing your image or adding additional services to a Docker network with Mage. Read more about Docker compose [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Be sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) are installed and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mage-ai/compose-quickstart.git mage-quickstart \
&& cd mage-quickstart \
&& cp dev.env .env \
&& rm dev.env \
&& docker compose up
```

### What's happening?

We're cloning our Docker Compose [quickstart repo](https://github.com/mage-ai/compose-quickstart.git), copying `dev.env` to `.env`, which is ignored by git in our configuration (to avoid exposing secrets), then running `docker compose up` to start a Mage server.

<Accordion title="Docker run" icon="docker">

First, be sure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed. Next, create a new folder for your project, cd into that folder, and run the following from your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
   ```bash Mac/Linux
   docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v $(pwd):/home/src mageai/mageai /app/run_app.sh mage start [project_name]
   ```
   ```bash Windows Command Line
   docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v %cd%:/home/src mageai/mageai /app/run_app.sh mage start [project_name]
   ```

   ```bash PowerShell
   docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v ${PWD}:/home/src mageai/mageai /app/run_app.sh mage start [project_name]
   ```
</CodeGroup>

### What's happening?

We're executing `docker run`, which runs a Docker container from the Mage image. additionally, we're _mounting a volume_ (the `-v` command) to persist our project files on our container. This mounts the current folder to `home/src` in the mage container. We're executing our docker image `mageai/mageai` and running a script to start up the container.

   1. Install Mage

       <CodeGroup>
          ```bash pip
          pip install mage-ai
          ```

          ```bash conda
          conda install -c conda-forge mage-ai
          ```
       </CodeGroup>
      <sub>If you're installing on Linux and need help, check out this [community provided video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVH7LHqND1I).</sub>

   2. Create new project and launch tool

      ```bash
      mage start [project_name]
      ```

   3. Open http://localhost:6789 in your browser and build a pipeline.
   4. Run pipeline after building it in the tool

      ```bash
      mage run [project_name] [pipeline]
      ```

   ### Initialize new project

   If you want to create a different project with a different name, run the
   following:

   ```bash
   mage init [project_name]
   ```

1. Start a Kubernetes cluster locally

   [Enable Kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/#enable-kubernetes) in Docker Desktop to start a kubernetes cluster locally.

   Other options for starting a Kubernetes cluster locally:
   * [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
   * [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

2. Download and update Kubernetes config file

   * Download Mage Kubernetes config file. https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/blob/master/kube/app.yaml
   * Replace the `/path/to/mage_project` in the config yaml with the path that you want to use to store your Mage projects.

3. Run Mage app in Kubernetes cluster

   * Install command line tool [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) if you haven't.
   * Run command `kubectl create -f kube/app.yaml` to run Mage in a Kubernetes pod.
   * You can check the pod status with command `kubectl get pods -o wide`.
   * Set up port forwarding with command `kubectl port-forward mage-server 6789:6789`.

3. Open http://localhost:6789 in your browser and build a pipeline.

4. (Optional) Enable blocks to be executed in separate Kubernetes pods.

   If you want the pipeline blocks to be executed in separate containers, you can follow the [guide](/production/configuring-production-settings/compute-resource#kubernetes-executor) to set `executor_type` of a block to `k8s` in pipeline's `metadata.yaml`.
