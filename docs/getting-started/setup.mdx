## ‚õµÔ∏è Overview

We recommend using Docker to get started.

Docker is a tool that allows you to run Mage in a containerized environment: you can run Mage on any operating system that supports Docker, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. Using Docker means that you don't have to worry about installing dependencies or configuring your environment. If you'd like to install Mage without Docker, you can use `pip` or `conda`.

If you're familiar with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or plan on adding or extending images (e.g. Postgres) in your project, we recommend starting from the _Docker compose template_. Otherwise, we recommend _Docker run_.

## ü™Ñ Get Mage

<AccordionGroup>
   <Accordion title="Docker compose template" icon="Docker">
   ### Get started

   The following is useful if you plan on customizing your image or adding additional services to a Docker network with Mage. Read more about Docker compose [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

   Be sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) are installed and run:
   <CodeGroup>
   ```bash Mac/Linux
   git clone https://github.com/mage-ai/compose-quickstart.git mage-quickstart \
   && cd mage-quickstart \
   && cp dev.env .env && rm dev.env \
   && docker compose up
   ```

   ```bash Windows
   git clone https://github.com/mage-ai/compose-quickstart.git mage-quickstart
   cd mage-quickstart
   cp dev.env .env
   rm dev.env
   docker compose up
   ```
   </CodeGroup>

   Once the server is running, open `http://localhost:6789` in your browser and explore! We recommend one of our [guides](/guides/overview) to for inspiration.

   ### What's happening?

   We're cloning our Docker Compose [quickstart repo](https://github.com/mage-ai/compose-quickstart.git), copying `dev.env` to `.env`, which is ignored by git in our configuration (to avoid exposing secrets), then running `docker compose up` to start a Mage server.

   </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Docker run" icon="docker">

   ### Get started

   First, be sure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed. Next, create a new folder for your project, change directory into that folder, and run the following from your terminal:

   <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Mac/Linux
      docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v $(pwd):/home/src mageai/mageai /app/run_app.sh mage start [project_name]
      ```
      ```bash Windows Command Line
      docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v "%cd%:/home/src" mageai/mageai /app/run_app.sh mage start [project_name]
      ```

      ```bash PowerShell
      docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v ${PWD}:/home/src mageai/mageai /app/run_app.sh mage start [project_name]
      ```

      ```bash GCP VM Instance
      sudo docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v $(pwd):/home/src mageai/mageai /app/run_app.sh mage start [project_name]
      ```
   </CodeGroup>

   Once the server is running, open `http://localhost:6789` in your browser and explore! If using any cloud provider use external IP address with the port eg 123.456.78:6789. We recommend one of our [guides](/guides/overview) for inspiration.

   ### What's happening?

   We're executing `docker run`, which runs a Docker container from the Mage image. additionally, we're _mounting a volume_ (the `-v` command) to persist our project files on our container. This mounts the current folder to `/home/src` in the mage container. We're executing our docker image `mageai/mageai` and running a script to start up the container.

      <Step title="Start a Kubernetes cluster locally">
         [Enable Kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/#enable-kubernetes) in Docker Desktop to start a Kubernetes cluster locally. Other options for starting a Kubernetes cluster locally are [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) and [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Download and update Kubernetes config file">
         First, download the Mage Kubernetes config file [here](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/blob/master/kube/app.yaml).
         Then, replace the `/path/to/mage_project` in the config yaml with the path that you want to use to store your Mage projects.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Run Mage app in Kubernetes cluster">
         Install the command line tool, [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl), if you haven't already. 
         Run the command `kubectl create -f kube/app.yaml` to run Mage in a Kubernetes pod. You can check the pod status with command `kubectl get pods -o wide`.
         Set up port forwarding with command `kubectl port-forward mage-server 6789:6789`.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run your first pipeline

If you haven't already, open a browser to `http://localhost:6789`. From the pipelines page, select `example_pipeline` and open the notebook view by selecting `Edit pipeline` from the left side nav.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/quickstart/open-pipeline.gif?raw=True"/>
</p>

Select the first block by clicking it and select the "play" icon in the top right to run the block. You've just ran your first Mage block & loaded data from a dataset!

<Accordion title="ü§î What's a block?">
<Snippet file="whats-a-block.mdx"/>
