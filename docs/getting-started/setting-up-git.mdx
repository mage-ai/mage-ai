## Choose your adventure

There three different ways to use Git in Mage and _four_ ways to version control your files— we'll discussing each of them.

If you're simply looking for version control, you're in luck! It ships out-of-the-box with Mage. That means you can _always_ restore previous versions of your files, even if you haven't configured
any version control system. Check out [this page](/getting-started/file-versions) for more info.
