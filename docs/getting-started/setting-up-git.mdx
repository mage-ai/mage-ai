## Choose your adventure

There three different ways to use Git in Mage and _four_ ways to version control your files— we'll discussing each of them. We note that our methods for using Git are mutually exclusive.

If you're simply looking for version control, you're in luck! It ships out-of-the-box with Mage. That means you can _always_ restore previous versions of your files, even if you haven't configured any version control system. Check out [this page](/getting-started/file-versions) for more info.

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| ✅          | I want to see a history of my file edits            | [Mage version control](/getting-started/file-versions)    | Beginner    | File-level versioning  |
| ✅          | I want to develop/deploy Mage using Git with GitHub | [GitHub version control](/production/data-sync/github)     | Moderate    | Full w/ OAuth          |
| ✅          | I want to deploy Mage using Git with any provider   | [Git integration with Git Sync](/production/data-sync/git-sync) | Advanced    | Full w/ SSH/HTTPS Auth |
| ⚠️          | I want to develop Mage using Git with any provider  | [Git integration _without_ Git Sync](/production/data-sync/git-integration)  | Advanced    | Full w/ SSH/HTTPS Auth |

## Example usage

Git Sync is particularly useful in production instances, where other Git methods are can be used more meaningfully in development instances. 

Since Git sync is a one-way sync, it's not very useful for collaboration, since changes get overridden. However, this makes it great for a production Mage instance, where verified changes should only be accepted from development environments.

A common pattern is to use devevelopment instances to edit and push (Git integration), then have production instances use Git Sync or CI/CD.

## Generating an SSH Token

Depending on your authentication method, you may need to generate an SSH token. See our guide here for [more information](/development/git/generate-an-ssh-token).
