description: "Mage can automatically keep track of previous versions of a file. Any update to the contents of a file will create a new version that can be used to restore a file to a previous state. This also includes changes to a pipeline."

## Configure the number of versions per file

You can set how many previous versions to keep track of for every file.

Set the following environment variable name and value:

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `MAX_NUMBER_OF_FILE_VERSIONS` |
| Value | Any integer value. |
| Default | `100` |

## Where are the file versions stored?

Each file version is stored in the following directory:

```
[project_name]/.file_versions
```

For example, if your project name is `demo_project`, then the directory will be `demo_project/.file_versions`.

Please add `.file_versions` to your `.gitignore` file. 
For more information, please read the [project setup guide](/development/project/setup#create-a-gitignore-file).
