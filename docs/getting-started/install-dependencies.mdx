Mage Pro includes an advanced dependency management system that automatically creates and manages isolated virtual environments for your projects. Adding new packages is simple and doesn't require cluster restarts - you can immediately run your code after installation.

## Quick Start: Installing Dependencies via UI

The easiest way to install dependencies is through the Mage UI:

<img
    alt="Requirements.txt"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mage-ai/assets/main/pro/cloud/requirements-txt.png"
/>

### Steps:

1. **Navigate to the Terminal page** in your Mage workspace

2. **Open `requirements.txt`**: Browse to `/home/src/[project_path]/requirements.txt` and click to open it in the editor

3. **Add your packages**: Edit the file to include your dependencies
   ```txt
   pandas==2.0.0
   numpy>=1.24.0
   scikit-learn==1.3.0
   ```

4. **Click the "Install dependencies" button**: This will automatically:
   - Open a terminal at the bottom of the page
   - Run `mage deps install` command
   - Show real-time installation progress
   - Install only the packages that need to be added or updated

/>

Your dependencies are now installed and ready to use - **no cluster restart required**!

## How It Works

Behind the scenes, Mage Pro's dependency management system:

- **Creates isolated virtual environments** for each unique combination of dependencies
- **Caches and reuses environments** based on content fingerprinting for faster installation
- **Intelligently filters packages** to reuse compatible packages from the global environment
- **Uses `uv` for fast installation** with automatic fallback to `pip`
- **Automatically activates environments** when the server starts

When you restart your cluster, the system automatically creates or updates the virtual environment based on your latest `requirements.txt`, ensuring your dependencies are always synchronized.

## Alternative Methods

### Via Mage Terminal

You can also run dependency commands directly in the Mage terminal:

```bash
# Install dependencies
mage deps install

# Install from custom requirements file
mage deps install -r production_requirements.txt

# List all virtual environments
mage deps list

# Clean up old environments
mage deps cleanup
```

### Automatic on Cluster Restart

When you restart your Mage cluster, dependencies are automatically installed based on your `requirements.txt` - no manual intervention needed.
