## 1. Set up new Mage project

Read the [setup guide](/getting-started/setup) to initialize a new project and
start the Mage tool locally.

For the rest of this tutorial, we’ll use the project name `demo_project`.

---

## 2. Set up DBT project

### Install DBT

<Warning>
   Skip this step if you’re using Mage in Docker.
   The Mage Docker image already has dbt installed.
</Warning>

1. Open Mage and go to the terminal page: http://localhost:6789/terminal
2. Add `dbt-postgres` to your project’s dependencies file (`requirements.txt`)
   by typing the following into the terminal in your browser:
   `bash echo dbt-postgres > demo_project/requirements.txt `
3. Install your project’s dependencies using `pip` by typing the following:

   ```bash
   pip install -r demo_project/requirements.txt
   ```

   For more information on installing DBT, read their
   [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started/pip-install).

### Create DBT project

1. Open Mage and go to the terminal page: http://localhost:6789/terminal
2. Initiate your DBT project using the `init` command (for this tutorial, we’ll
   use the DBT project name `demo`):

   ```bash
   cd demo_project/dbt
   dbt init demo -s
   touch demo/profiles.yml
   ```

   For more information on creating a DBT project, read their
   [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started/getting-started-dbt-core#create-a-project).

---

## 3. Create standard pipeline

1. Go to the [Mage dashboard](http://localhost:6789/) and click the button
   **`+ New pipeline`** and select the option labeled `Standard (batch)`.
2. Near the top of the page, click the pipeline name and change it to
   `dbt demo pipeline`.

---

## 4. Create DBT profile for database connections

1. On the left side of the page in the file browser, expand the folder
   `demo_project/dbt/demo/`.
2. Click the file named `profiles.yml`.
3. Paste the following credentials in that file:
   ```yaml
   demo:
     target: dev
     outputs:
       dev:
         dbname: mage/demo
         host: db.bit.io
         password: v2_43Yy3_5LtqyXUE3ew6PrqH2y8zQyH
         port: 5432
         schema: dbt_demo
         type: postgres
         user: demo
   ```
4. Save the `profiles.yml` file by pressing `Command (⌘)` + `S`.
5. Close the file by pressing the **`X`** button on the right side of the file
   name `dbt/demo/profiles.yml`.

---

## 5. Add data loader block to pipeline

1. Click the **`+ Data loader`** button, select `Python`, then click `API`.
2. At the top of the block, on the right of `DATA LOADER`, click the name of the
   block.
3. Change the name to `load data`.
4. Paste the following code in that block:

    ```python
    import io
    import pandas as pd
    import requests
    from pandas import DataFrame


    @data_loader
    def load_data_from_api(**kwargs) -> DataFrame:
        url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mage-ai/datasets/master/restaurant_user_transactions.csv'

        response = requests.get(url)
        df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(response.text), sep=',')
        df.columns = ['_'.join(col.split(' ')) for col in df.columns]
        return df
    ```
---

## 6. Add DBT model block to pipeline

1. Under the data loader block you just added, click the button **`DBT model`**,
   then click the option `Single model`.
1. In the file browser that pops up, click the file named
   `my_second_dbt_model.sql` under the folders `demo/models/example/`. 
   
   1. This will add 2 DBT blocks to your pipeline: 1 for the DBT model named
   `my_first_dbt_model` and the 2nd for the DBT model named `my_second_dbt_model`. 
   
   1. The model named `my_first_dbt_model` was added to
   the pipeline because `my_second_dbt_model` references it.

![](https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/dbt/add-dbt-model.gif?raw=true)

### 6a. Edit DBT model `my_first_dbt_model`

1. In the DBT block named `my_first_dbt_model`, next to the label
   `DBT profile target` at the top is an input field, enter `dev`.
2. Paste the following SQL into the DBT model named `my_first_dbt_model`:

   ```sql
   WITH source_data AS (
       SELECT 1 AS id
       UNION ALL
       SELECT 2 AS id
   )

   SELECT *
   FROM source_data
   ```

3. Run the DBT model block by pressing the play button on the top right of the
   block or by pressing `Command` + `Enter`.
4. You should see a preview of the query results.

![](https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/dbt/dbt-preview.gif?raw=true)

5. After previewing the results, in the top right corner of the block, click on the triple dots to reveal a dropdown menu.
6. Under the dropdown menu, click the option <b>Run model</b>. This command will execute the `dbt run` command and create the table in your data source.

### 6b. Edit DBT model `my_second_dbt_model`

1. In the DBT block named `my_second_dbt_model`, next to the label
   `DBT profile target` at the top is an input field, enter `dev`.
2. Paste the following SQL into the DBT model named `my_second_dbt_model`:

   ```sql
   SELECT
       a.*
       , b.*
   FROM {{ ref('my_first_dbt_model') }} AS a

   LEFT JOIN {{ source('mage_demo', 'dbt_demo_pipeline_load_data') }} AS b
   ON 1 = 1

   WHERE a.id = 1
   ```

   > [DBT sources](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources)
   >
   > When a DBT model depends on an upstream block that isn’t a DBT model, a
   > source for that block is automatically added to the
   > `demo_project/dbt/demo/models/example/mage_sources.yml` file.
   >
   > Read more about DBT sources in their
   > [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources).

3. Run the DBT model block by pressing the play button on the top right of the
   block or by pressing `Command` + `Enter`.
4. You should see a preview of the query results.

---

## 7. Add test for DBT model

1. On the right side of the screen, click the tab labeled **`Terminal`**.
2. Create a new DBT test file by running the following command:
   ```bash
   touch demo_project/dbt/demo/tests/test_my_second_dbt_model.sql
   ```
3. On the left side of the page in the file browser, expand the folder
   `demo_project/dbt/demo/tests/` and click the file named
   `test_my_second_dbt_model.sql`. If you don’t see it, refresh the page.
4. Paste the following SQL in the file:
   ```sql
   SELECT id
   FROM {{ ref('my_second_dbt_model') }}
   GROUP BY id
   HAVING (id = 0)
   ```
5. Read more about DBT tests in their
   [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/tests).

---

## 8. Execute pipeline end-to-end

1.  Click the name of the pipeline in the header breadcrumbs to go back to the
    detail page.
2.  Create a new trigger (you can use any interval you want for this tutorial).
    For more details, follow these
    [steps](design/data-pipeline-management#create-trigger).
3.  After your trigger is created, click the **`Start trigger`** button at the
    top of the page.
4.  The pipeline will eventually fail because a DBT test failed. This means
    everything is working as expected.
5.  Open the file `demo_project/dbt/demo/models/example/schema.yml` and remove
    the tests named `unique` under both models. Your file should look like this:

    ```yaml 

    version: 2

    models:
      - name: my_first_dbt_model
        description: "A starter dbt model"
        columns:
          - name: id
            description: "The primary key for this table"
            tests:
              - not_null

      - name: my_second_dbt_model
        description: "A starter dbt model"
        columns:
          - name: id
            description: "The primary key for this table"
            tests:
              - not_null

    ```

6.  Click on the **`Failed`** button next to the pipeline run and click
    **`Retry run`**. It should complete running successfully after a few
    minutes.

Congratulations! You’ve created a data pipeline that orchestrates your DBT
models.
