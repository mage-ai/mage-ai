## Intro


### Changing columns

Sometimes, we can't control what data upstream of our pipelines contains. ðŸ˜”

Thankfully, [Mage Community](https://join.slack.com/t/mageai/shared_invite/zt-1adn34w4m-t~TcnPTlo3~5~d_0raOp6A) member [Josh Pachner](https://mageai.slack.com/team/U05B9DLK0N7) has a solution. 

Say you have an upstream block that looks like:

```SQL
SELECT 
  df."col_1",
  df."col_2",
  df."col_3",
FROM {{ df }} df
```

Where the underlying `df` might all three columns... or just a subset. ðŸ˜…

For cases where expected columns _might_ not be present, we can add a transformer block upstream of an exporter:

```python
# headers = [cols we need in our dataframe]
# df = our DataFrame()

for head in headers:
  if head not in df.columns:
       df[head] = None
```
This is especially helpful in databases like Snowflake, which don't have an `iferror()` function to check for missing columns.
