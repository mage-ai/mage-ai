## Code and output side-by-side view

Run code and see its output right next to where you’re writing.

This makes it so that you don’t have to keep scrolling down every time you make a code change
and want to see its results.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Drag blocks from the file browser and drop it on the pipeline" icon="dragon">
        1. Open the file browser.
        1. Click a file and keep holding down.
        1. Drag the file into the center of the page.
        1. Release the button and it’ll be added to the pipeline.

                <img
                    alt="Drag blocks from the file browser and drop it on the pipeline"
                    src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/dev-ux/code-editor/drag-block.gif?raw=true"
                />
            </p>
        </Frame>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Search blocks across entire projects" icon="searchengin">
        Find existing code and add it to the current pipeline.

        <Note>
            You must 1st enable the feature named <b>Add new block v2</b> in your
            [project settings](http://localhost:6789/settings/workspace/preferences).

            If you just recently enabled the feature <b>Add new block v2</b>, you must restart Mage
            so that your blocks can be indexed.
        </Note>

        Instead of clicking a button to add a new block, type in the search bar to find an
        existing block across all your projects. 

        <Frame>
            <p align="center">
                <img

            </p>
        </Frame>

        <Tip>
            ⌘ + ⇧ (Command + Shift) keyboard shortcut will instantly focus your typing on the
            search bar from anywhere on the page (as long as you aren’t already typing in a 
            block of code).
        </Tip>

        <Tip>
            Use the arrow up and arrow down key to browse
