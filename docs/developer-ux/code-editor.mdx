## Code and output side-by-side view

Run code and see its output right next to where you’re writing.

This makes it so that you don’t have to keep scrolling down every time you make a code change
and want to see its results.

## Adding blocks made easy

You can quickly add blocks of code to your pipeline with these methods:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Drag blocks from the file browser and drop it on the pipeline" icon="dragon">
        1. Open the file browser.
        1. Click a file and keep holding down.
        1. Drag the file into the center of the page.
        1. Release the button and it’ll be added to the pipeline.

        </Frame>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Search blocks across entire projects" icon="searchengin">
        Find existing code and add it to the current pipeline.

        <Note>
            You must 1st enable the feature named <b>Add new block v2</b> in your
            [project settings](http://localhost:6789/settings/workspace/preferences).

            If you just recently enabled the feature <b>Add new block v2</b>, you must restart Mage
            so that your blocks can be indexed.
        </Note>

        Instead of clicking a button to add a new block, type in the search bar to find an
        existing block across all your projects. 

        <Frame>
            <p align="center">

        </Frame>

        <Tip>
            ⌘ + ⇧ (Command + Shift) keyboard shortcut will instantly focus your typing on the
            search bar from anywhere on the page (as long as you aren’t already typing in a 
            block of code).
        </Tip>

        <Tip>
            Use the arrow up and arrow down key to browse
            through the results.

## Re-arrange and hide or show blocks

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="Show blocks in current pipeline" icon="user-secret">
        When editing a pipeline, you can switch the file browser view to show only the blocks in the
        current pipeline.

        After toggling this view, you can select which blocks to collapse and which to expand. 
        This can help optimize vertical screen space while writing code.

Sync data from 3rd party sources without writing boilerplate code by using pre-built
data integrations (Singer Taps and Targets) provided by the data engineering community.

<Tip>
    Data integrations to sync your data to 3rd party destinations are also available in the
    same feature set.
</Tip> 

<Tip>
    These sources and destinations can be combined and chained together with
    your existing blocks.
