Applications are standalone experiences that can be opened and ran simultaneously alongside 
other applications or any other page in Mage.

## Resizable window

Adjust the width and/or height of the application window.

        src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/raw/main/dev-ux/applications/resizable.gif?raw=true"
    />
    </p>
</Frame>

1. Drag the horizontal (left, right) edges to resize the width. 
1. Drag the bottom edge to resize the height.
1. Drag any corner to resize the width and height simultaneously.

## Reposition anywhere on the screen

Place the application anywhere on the screen by dragging the header and moving it to the desired location.

## Automatic layout

<Frame>
    <video
        controls
        className="w-full aspect-video"
        src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/raw/main/dev-ux/applications/automatic-layout.mp4"
    />
</Frame>

In addition to manually resizing and positioning applications, take advantage of these
auto-layout features:

1. Drag the header and your mouse pointer to the left edge (approximately vertically centered) and
    the application will left align to the screen and stretch almost full height and almost 50% width.
1. Drag the header and your mouse pointer to the right edge instead and it’ll align to the right side of
    the screen.
1. Drag the header and your mouse pointer to the top edge (approximately horizontally centered) and
    the application will align to the top of the screen and stretch almost full width and almost 50% height.
1. Drag the header and your mouse pointer to the bottom edge (approximately horizontally centered) and
    the application will align to the bottom of the screen and stretch almost full width and almost 50% height.
1. Drag the header and your mouse pointer to any of the 4 corners of the screen and the application will align
    to that corner and stretch fill approximately 50% of the width and height of the screen.
1. In the top right corner of the application window, there is a green button. Click that button to maximize the
    application window height and width to fill as much space as possible.

<Note>
    Applications will always try to leave padding around its edges so that the page behind it can be visible.
    Therefore, applications won’t fill up 100% of full width or height of the screen.
</Note>

## Minimize application

If the application is currently not being used and you need the space on the screen, 
you can either close the application by clicking the red circle button in the top right corner of the
window or you can minimize the application by clicking the yellow circle.

<Frame>
    <video
        controls
        className="w-full aspect-video"
        src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/raw/main/dev-ux/applications/minimize.mp4"
    />
</Frame>


Minimized applications will live in the dock at the bottom of the screen.

<Frame>
    <p align="center">
    <img
        alt="Applications dock"
        src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/raw/main/dev-ux/applications/dock.png?raw=true"
    />
    </p>
</Frame>

Click the minimized window at the bottom of the screen and the application will be restored to
its original size and position.
