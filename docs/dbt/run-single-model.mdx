1. Under the data loader block you just added, click the button **`DBT model`**,
   then click the option `Single model`.
2. In the file browser that pops up, click the file of the DBT model you want to
   add to your pipeline.
3. In the `DBT profile target` input field, enter the name of the DBT connection
   profile (e.g. `dev`) that you want to use when running the selected DBT
   models.

## Depending on upstream blocks

If your DBT model references other models, those models will also be added to
the current pipeline as upstream blocks.

Once you’ve added 1 or more DBT models to your pipeline, you can set its
dependencies on other blocks.

The DBT model won’t run until all upstream blocks have successfully been
completed.

## Preview DBT model results

You can run a DBT model block and see the results of the SQL query.

Under the hood, Mage is running
[`dbt compile`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/compile) for that
single model, then executing the compiled SQL query in the data source from your
DBT project’s
[connection profile](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started/connection-profiles)
target.

## Pipeline execution run

When pipeline is triggered and executes, it’ll run each DBT model block using
the [`dbt run`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax)
command.

---

## Variable interpolation

You can add
[variables](/production/configuring-production-settings/runtime-variable)
specific to your pipeline. These variables are accessible in each block of your
pipeline.

In addition, all the environment variables are accessible within the SQL query
using the `var` syntax.

| Syntax             | Description                                                      | Example           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `{{ var('...') }}` | Get a value from the environment variables or runtime variables. | `{{ var('ds') }}` |

### SQL statement

Within the SQL query in a DBT model block, you can access these variables using
the `var` syntax. To learn more, read
[DBT’s documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/var).
For example:

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM users_v1
WHERE created_at >= '{{ var("ds") }}'
```

In the above example, the variable named `ds` is defined as part of the runtime
variables for the pipeline.
