## Generating docs

Before enabling dbt docs in production, we need to make sure the static files for the docs are generated.

1. Configure the dbt super project.
    * Your dbt projects should be in the `/path/to/<mage_project>/dbt` directory.
        * The `/dbt` directory will serve as a "super-project" for all of your dbt projects in your Mage project.
    * Make sure the `/.../<mage_project>/dbt` directory has the files `dbt_project.yml`, `profiles.yml`, and `packages.yml`. These files are needed for dbt to create docs for all the projects within this directory.
        1. `dbt_project.yml`
            ```yaml
            name: 'base'
            version: '1.0.0'
            config-version: 2
            profile: 'base'
            target-path: "target"
            clean-targets:
              - "target"
              - "dbt_packages"
            ```
        1. `profiles.yml`: The config in this file is not used, but it needs to still be a valid output target in order for the project to compile.
            ```yaml
            base:
              target: dev
              outputs:
                dev:
                  <output_config>
            ```
        1. `packages.yml`: Add all projects that you want to be included in the documentation.
            ```yaml
            packages:
              - local: ./project1
              - local: ./project2
            ```
2. Generate the dbt docs
    ```bash
      dbt deps
      dbt docs generate
    ```


## Terraform

### GCP

In the [mage-ai-terraform-templates](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates) repository, the terraform templates for GCP have commented out resources at the end of the following files for enabling the dbt docs service.
* [main.tf](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/gcp/main.tf#L184)
* [load_balancer.tf](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/gcp/load_balancer.tf#L81)

Once you uncomment those resources, you should see an output `docs_service_ip` at the end of `terraform apply` with the IP to access the dbt docs in the cloud.

```bash
Outputs:
docs_service_ip = "<dbt_docs_ip>"
service_ip = "<mage_ip>"
```
