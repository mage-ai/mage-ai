Mage will look for a file named `profiles.yml` located in your dbt project root
folder.

For example, if your Mage project is named `demo_project` and your dbt project
name is `demo`, then your `profiles.yml` file for that dbt project should be
located in `demo_project/dbt/demo/profiles.yml`.

If you have a 2nd dbt project (e.g. named `example`), the connection profiles
for that project should be located in `demo_project/dbt/example/profiles.yml`.

For more information on how to configure your connection profiles, read
[dbtâ€™s documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started/connection-profiles).

## How connection profiles are used

When you run a [single dbt model](/dbt/run-single-model) or
[selected dbt models](/dbt/run-selected-model), there is an input field labeled
`dbt profile target`. The value in that field will be the connection profile
target that Mage uses when running a dbt model block.

The command Mage executes is `dbt run` with the flag `--target` and the value of
that flag is the value from the input field labeled `dbt profile target`.

## Variable interpolation

You can add
[variables](/getting-started/runtime-variable)
specific to your pipeline. These variables are accessible in each block of your
pipeline.

In addition, all the environment variables are accessible within the SQL query
using the `var` syntax.

| Syntax                   | Description                                 | Example                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `{{ env_var('...') }}`   | Get a value from the environment variables. | `{{ env_var('ENV') }}`              |
| `{{ variables('...') }}` | Get a value from the runtime variables.     | `{{ variables('execution_date') }}` |

### dbt profile target

When typing in the dbt profile target for a dbt block, you can explicitly state
the target (e.g. `dev`) you want the block to use or you can use variable
interpolation. For example:

| Key   | Example string                  | Result          |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `ENV` | `postgres_{{ env_var('ENV') }}` | `postgres_prod` |
