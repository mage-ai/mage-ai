In addition to configurint triggers via UI, you can also configure triggers in code.

## Create and configure triggers

Here are the steps to create and configure triggers via code:
1. Create a `triggers.yaml` file under your pipeline folder. The file path should be `pipelines/[pipeline_uuid]/triggers.yaml`.
1. Enter your trigger configs into the `triggers.yaml` file.
    1. Content structure
        ```yaml
        triggers:
        - name: test_trigger
          schedule_type: time
          start_time: 2023-01-01
          status: active
        - name: xxx
          ...
        - name: xxx
          ...
        ```
    1. Required trigger fields
        1. `name`: Unique identifier of the trigger
        1. `schedule_type`: `time`, `api`, or `event`
        1. `schedule_interval`: `@once`, `@hourly`, "@daily", `@weekly`, `@monthly`, or Cron syntax(`* * * * *`)
        1. `start_time`: The start time of the trigger (e.g. `2023-01-01`)
    1. Optional trigger fields
        1. `status`: `active` or `inactive`
        1. `variables`: A dictionary of variables that's associated with the trigger
        1. `sla`: SLA in seconds
1. Save the `triggers.yaml` file. The trigger configs will be synced to the triggers UI shortly.


### Example triggers config:

```yaml
triggers:
- name: test_example_trigger
  schedule_type: time
  schedule_interval: "@daily"
  start_time: 2023-01-01
  status: active
- name: test_example_trigger_2
  schedule_type: time
  schedule_interval: "@hourly"
  start_time: 2023-03-01
  status: inactive
```

## Modify triggers

For triggers that are configured in yaml file, any trigger settings made through UI will be overriden by
the config from yaml file. Thus, to modify the trigger settings, you'll need to update the trigger configs
in yaml file directly. The new trigger configs will be automatically synced to the triggers in UI.


## Delete triggers

If you don't want to use a trigger anymore, you can either update the trigger status to `inactive` or
delete the trigger completely.

To delete the trigger completely, you'll need to remove the trigger config from the yaml file first and
then delete the trigger from the UI.
