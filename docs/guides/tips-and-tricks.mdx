<Accordion title="New Tree View" icon="tree">
  We've received a ton of feedback from our users, and we've been hard at work making updates to the tree view based on your suggestions. So, what's new? Let me give you the lowdown. 👇

  🔹 Enhanced Functionality: The tree view now comes with a whole right-click menu that allows you to easily run, rename, insert, or delete blocks. You have more control than ever before!

  🔹 Seamless Connections: You can now remove and add connections with a simple click. Plus, you can insert new blocks between existing ones effortlessly.

  🔹 Enhanced Visualizations: With the new tree view, you get grouping and better lineage for certain block types 🔄

  Not only does the new tree view offer improved functionality, but it also makes your pipelines look absolutely stunning! After all, our goal is to make data beautiful. 💫
