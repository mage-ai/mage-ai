<Note>
  This tutorial requires that you already have Airflow setup and running
  locally.
</Note>
<Steps titleSize="h2">
<Step title="Add `mage-ai` as a dependency in Airflow">

Open the `requirements.txt` file in the root directory of your Airflow project,
and add the `mage-ai` library:

```
mage-ai
```
</Step>
<Step title=" Install Mage">

You can install and run Mage using Docker or using pip.

### Using Docker

```bash
docker pull mageai/mageai:latest
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install mage-ai
```
</Step>
<Step title="Initialize Mage project">

Change directory into your Airflow’s DAGs folder. This is typically in the
folder `dags/`.

```bash
cd dags
```

Then, initialize a new Mage project in the `dags/` folder.

If you’re using Docker, run the following command in the `dags/` folder:

```bash
docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v $(pwd):/home/src \
  mageai/mageai /app/run_app.sh mage init demo_project

```

If you used pip to install Mage, run the following command in the `dags/`
folder:

```bash
mage init demo_project
```

Once finished, you should have a folder named `demo_project` inside your `dags/`
folder.

Your current folder structure should look like this:

```
airflow_root_directory/
| -- dags/
| -- | -- demo_project/
```
</Step>
<Step title="Create one-time DAG for pipelines">

In the `dags/` folder, create a new file named `create_mage_pipelines.py`.

Then, add the following code:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
from mage_ai.orchestration.airflow import create_dags
import os


ABSOLUTE_PATH = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
project_path = os.path.join(ABSOLUTE_PATH, 'demo_project')

create_dags(
    project_path,
    DAG,
    PythonOperator,
    dag_settings=dict(
        start_date=datetime(2022, 8, 5),  # Change this to any start date you want
    ),
    globals_dict=globals(),
)
```
</Step>

<Step title="Create pipeline">

### Start Mage

In the `dags/` folder, start the Mage tool.

If you’re using Docker, run the following command in the `dags/` folder:

```bash
docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v $(pwd):/home/src \
  mageai/mageai /app/run_app.sh mage start demo_project

```

If you used pip to install Mage, run the following command in the `dags/`
folder:

```bash
mage start demo_project
```

Open [http://localhost:6789](http://localhost:6789) in your browser.



</Step>
<Step title="Add a block">
Follow steps 1, 2, and 4 in this [tutorial](/guides/load-api-data) to create
a new pipeline, add 1 data loader block, and add 1 transformer block.
</Step>
<Step title="Run DAG in Airflow for pipeline">

1. Open the Airflow webserver UI at
   [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
2. If you named your pipeline `etl demo` based on the tutorial from the previous
   step, then find a DAG named `mage_pipeline_etl_demo`. If you named it
   something else, find a DAG with the prefix `mage_pipeline_`.
3. Click on the DAG to view the detail page. The URL could typically be this:
   [http://localhost:8080/admin/airflow/tree?dag_id=mage_pipeline_etl_demo](http://localhost:8080/admin/airflow/tree?dag_id=mage_pipeline_etl_demo).
4. Turn that DAG on if its currently off.
5. Trigger a new DAG run.
6. Watch the DAG as it runs each task according to the pipeline you created in
   Mage.
