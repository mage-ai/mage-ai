In your pipeline, you can add sensors that run continuously and only complete
when an external pipeline or external block is successfully ran for a particular
partition.

Then, you can add a block in your pipeline that depends on that sensor.

Therefore, your block wonâ€™t start running until the external pipeline or
external block has successfully ran.
