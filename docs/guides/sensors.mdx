In your pipeline, you can add sensors that run continuously and only complete
when an external pipeline or external block is successfully ran for a particular
partition.

Then, you can add a block in your pipeline that depends on that sensor.

Therefore, your block won’t start running until the external pipeline or
external block has successfully ran.

## Setup

1. [Add a sensor to your pipeline](/design/blocks/sensor)
2. [Configuring a sensor](/design/core-abstractions#sensor)
