## Trigger

A trigger is a set of instructions that determine when or how a pipeline should
run. A pipeline can have 1 or more triggers.

There are 3 types of triggers:

1. Schedule
2. Event
3. API

#### Schedule

A schedule-type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run after a start date and
on a set interval.

Currently, the frequency pipelines can be scheduled for include:

- Run exactly once
- Hourly
- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Every N minutes (coming soon)

#### Event

An event-type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run whenever a specific
event occurs.

For example, you can have a pipeline start running when a database query is
finished executing or when a new object is created in Amazon S3 or Google
Storage.

You can also trigger a pipeline using your own custom event by making a `POST`
request to the `http://localhost/api/events` endpoint with a custom event
payload.

#### API

An API-type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run after a specific API call
is made.

You can make a POST request to an endpoint provided in the UI when creating or
editing a trigger. You can optionally include runtime variables in your request
payload.

#### Additional trigger settings

* (Schedule triggers only) Skip run if previous run still in progress
  * Enabling this setting will tell the scheduler to not initialize the current run if any
    previous run for this trigger is still in progress.
* Allow blocks to fail
  * Enabling this setting will tell the scheduler to continue running the trigger even if 
    a block in the pipeline fails during the execution. The pipeline will continue to run 
    blocks that are not dependent on the failed blocks until the pipeline is complete.
