Mage Pro includes built-in file versioning, eliminating the need to configure Git for rolling back changes or recovering previous file versions.

### How It Works

Every update to a file's contents automatically creates a new version that can be restored at any time. This applies to all files, including pipeline configurations.

### Restoring a Previous File Version

1. **Open the file** – In the pipeline editor, select the file you want to recover from the left hand file browser
2. **Access version history** – Click the "Version history" button in the top-left portion of the file browser

        />
    </p>
</Frame>

3. **Select a version** – Choose the version you want to restore from the available options
4. **Restore** – Click the "Restore this version" button to apply the changes

        />
    </p>

Once restored, the selected version becomes the current active version of your file.

Version history gives you the confidence to experiment and iterate freely without fear of losing work. If you make a mistake or need to reference previous logic, you can always roll back to any saved version.
