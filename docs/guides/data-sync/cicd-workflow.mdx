## Introduction

Mage Pro supports two CI/CD approaches to fit different organizational needs. Both follow the same core workflow: develop → staging → deploy to production using the Git terminal and the Mage Pro deployment application.

This document clarifies the two primary CI/CD approaches available in Mage Pro:

1. **CI/CD by cluster** - Separate clusters for development, staging, and production
2. **CI/CD by workspace** - Multiple workspaces within a single cluster

Both approaches follow the same core principles: develop in isolation, test thoroughly, and deploy safely to production. The choice between cluster based and workspace based workflows depends on your infrastructure requirements, security policies, and team structure.

## 1. CI/CD by cluster

**Setup:** Separate clusters for each environment

- **Development cluster** - Active development
- **Staging cluster** (optional) - Pre-production validation
- **Production cluster** - Live pipelines

## 2. CI/CD by workspace

**Setup:** Single cluster with multiple workspaces (see our [workspaces guide](https://docs.mage.ai/guides/developer-ux/workspaces) for more details on configuring workspaces)

- **Development workspace** - Active development
- **Staging workspace** (optional) - Pre-production validation
- **Production workspace** - Live pipelines

## Git Branch Strategy & Environment Mapping

### Recommended Branch Structure

```python
main/master     → Production environment
staging         → Staging environment  
development     → Development environment
feature/*       → Development environment (feature branches)
```

### Workflow Best Practices

**Development:**

- Create feature branches from `development`: `feature/new-pipeline`
- Develop pipelines in feature branch and push changes to Github using the Git terminal (for more details on pushing code to Github see Mage Pro’s [Git terminal](https://docs.mage.ai/guides/data-sync/git-terminal) doc)

**Staging:**

- Merge `development` → `staging` when ready for testing
- Staging environment deploys from `staging` branch
- Run full validation and integration tests

**Production:**

- Merge `staging` → `main` after successful testing
- Production environment deploys from `main` branch only
- Use deployment application for controlled production releases (for more on Mage Pro’s deployment application see the [version control guide](https://docs.mage.ai/guides/data-sync/version-control-guide))

### Environment-Specific Configurations

**Same Code, Different Targets:**
The same codebase connects to different systems using environment-specific configurations:

**Environment Variables & Secrets:**

- Each cluster/workspace maintains its own connection settings
- `DATABASE_URL` points to dev/staging/prod databases
- `API_KEYS` use environment-appropriate credentials

**Configuration Examples:**

```python
Development:   DATABASE_URL = dev-warehouse.company.com
Staging:          DATABASE_URL = staging-warehouse.company.com  
Production:    DATABASE_URL = prod-warehouse.company.com
```

**In Mage Pro:**

- Configure different data source connections per environment
- Use environment variables in pipeline io_config.yaml file: `{{ env_var('DATABASE_URL') }}`
    - or python interpolation in a block `os.environ.get('DB_USERNAME')`

Using these strategies will allow you to develop the same pipeline code, but select different source and targets for each cluster / workspace environment.

## Conclusion

Both approaches use the same tools and follow identical workflows. The choice depends on your infrastructure and security requirements. Use [Git terminal](https://docs.mage.ai/guides/data-sync/git-terminal) for code management and the deployment application for production deployments in either setup. Use our [version control guide](https://docs.mage.ai/guides/data-sync/version-control-guide) to implement this in your Mage Pro environment.
