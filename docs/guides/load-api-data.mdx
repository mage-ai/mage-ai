## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll create a data pipeline with the following steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Load data from an online endpoint">
    We'll use a Python block to load data from an online endpoint— a CSV file containing restaurant user transactions. We'll also run a test to make sure the data is clean.
</Step>
<Step title="Clean column names and add a new column">
    We'll use a Python block to transform the data by cleaning the columns and creating a new column, `number of meals`, that counts the number of meals for each user.
</Step>
<Step title="Write the transformed data to a local DuckDB database">
    Finally, we'll write the transformed data to a locak DuckDB table.
</Step>
</Steps>

If you haven't created a Mage project before, follow the [setup guide](/getting-started/setup) before starting this tutorial.

## Quickstart
Want to dive in? Simply run the following command to clone a pre-built repo:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Mac/Linux
git clone https://github.com/mage-ai/etl-demo mage-etl-demo \
&& cd mage-etl-demo \
&& cp dev.env .env && rm dev.env \
&& docker compose up
```

```bash Windows
git clone https://github.com/mage-ai/etl-demo mage-etl-demo 
cd mage-etl-demo
cp dev.env .env
rm dev.env
docker compose up
```
</CodeGroup>

Then navigate to `https://localhost:6789` in your browser to see the pipeline in action!

## Tutorial

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="1️⃣ Create a pipeline">
        Open the pipelines list page (`/pipelines`). This is the default page when navigating to Mage in your web browser. If you have Mage running, just click [here](https://localhost:6789/pipelines).

        In the top left corner, select the button labeled *+ New*, then select the option labeled *Standard (batch)* to create a new pipeline.

        In the left vertical navigation, click the last link labeled *Pipeline settings*. Change the pipeline's name to `ETL demo`. Click the button labeled *Save pipeline settings*.

            />
        </Frame>

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="2️⃣ Load data from an API">
        In the left vertical navigation, click the 1st link labeled *Edit pipeline*. Click the button labeled *+ Data loader* then hover over *Python*, and click the option labeled *API*.

        A dialog menu will appear. Change the block name to `load data`. Click the button labeled *Save and add block*. Paste the following code in the data loader block:

        ```python
        import io
        import pandas as pd
        import requests


        @data_loader
        def load_data_from_api(*args, **kwargs):
            url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mage-ai/datasets/master/restaurant_user_transactions.csv'
            response = requests.get(url)
            return pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(response.text), sep=',')


        @test
        def test_row_count(df, *args) -> None:
            assert len(df.index) >= 1000, 'The data does not have enough rows.'
        ```

        Run the block by clicking the play icon button in the top right corner of the data loader block or one of the following keyboard shortcuts:

        * `⌘ + Enter`
        * `Control + Enter`
        * `Shift + Enter`

        After you run the block (⌘ + Enter), you'll see a sample of the data that was loaded.

                />
            </Frame>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="3️⃣ Transform data">
        Let's transform the data in 2 ways:

        * Add a column that counts the number of meals for each user.
        * Clean the column names to properly store in a PostgreSQL database.

        Follow these steps:

        Click the button labeled *+ Transformer*, then hover over *Python*, and click the option labeled *Generic (no template)*. Paste the following code in the transformer block:

        ```python
        def number_of_rows_per_key(df, key, column_name):
            data = df.groupby(key)[key].agg(['count'])
            data.columns = [column_name]
            return data


        def clean_column(column_name):
            return column_name.lower().replace(' ', '_')


        @transformer
        def transform(df, *args, **kwargs):
            # Add number of meals for each user
            df_new_column = number_of_rows_per_key(df, 'user ID', 'number of meals')
            df = df.join(df_new_column, on='user ID')

            # Clean column names
            df.columns = [clean_column(col) for col in df.columns]

            return df.iloc[:100]


        @test
        def test_number_of_columns(df, *args) -> None:
            assert len(df.columns) >= 11, 'There needs to be at least 11 columns.'
        ```

        Run the block by clicking the play icon button in the top right corner of the data loader block or press 1 of the following keyboard shortcuts:
        - `⌘ + Enter`
        - `Control + Enter`
        - `Shift + Enter`

        After you run the block (⌘ + Enter), you'll see a sample of the data that was transformed.

                src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/tutorials/etl/transform-data.gif?raw=true"
            />
        </Frame>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="4️⃣ Export data to DuckDB">
        Let's export the data to a local DuckDB database! Create a new `Data Exporter` block and change the type to be `DuckDB`. 

        Next, change the `Table name` to be `magic_duck.restaurant_user_transactions` and make sure the content of the block is: 

        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM {{ df_1 }}
        ``` 

        This will take our data from the previous block and export it to a local DuckDB table— `magic_duck.restaurant_user_transactions`! 🎉

        After you run the block (⌘ + Enter), you'll see a sample of the data that was exported.

        <Frame>
            <img
                alt="Export data"
                src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/tutorials/etl/export-data.gif?raw=true"
            />
        </Frame>

        You should also see some logs indicating the export was completed, e.g.

        ```bash
        DuckDB initialized
        └─ Opening connection to DuckDB...DONE
        Exporting data from upstream block floral_star to restaurant_user_transactions.

        ```
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**🎉 Congratulations!**
