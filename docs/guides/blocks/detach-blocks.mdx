title: "Detaching blocks"
description: "Detach other pipeline associations from a block shared by multiple pipelines."

## Overview

If a block is being used by multiple pipelines, changing the content of that block
will change it for all of the pipelines sharing that block. If you want to create an
isolated copy of that block for a specific pipeline so it doesn't affect other
pipelines sharing it, you can "detach" it.

Detaching a block duplicates it so it is no longer shared with any other pipelines,
removing/detaching other pipeline associations. A new block file is created with the
original block's contents, and the original block's dependencies in the current pipeline
are preserved.

### Supported pipeline types

Detaching a block is supported in `standard` and `streaming` pipelines. It is not supported
in `integration` pipelines.

### Supported block types

- Data loader
- Transformer
- Data exporter
- Sensor
- Custom

### Unsupported block types

- DBT
- Callback
- Conditional
- Extension

## How to detach a block

<img src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/blocks/detach_block.png?raw=True" />

1. If a block is shared by multiple pipelines, there will be a symbol, which looks something
like `<> X pipelines`, with the number of pipelines in the block's header on the Pipeline
Editor page. Refer to the screenshot above for an example. All 3 of the example pipeline's
blocks in the screenshot are shared by multiple pipelines.

2. Click on the shared pipelines symbol (`<>`) or the block settings icon in the block
header to go to the Block Settings panel in the Sidekick.

3. Click on the `Detach </>` button at the top right of the block settings panel. Note
that this button will only be visible if the selected block is shared by multiple pipelines.
Blocks that are not shared by any other pipelines do not have the option to detach itself.

4. A popup will appear allowing you to name the new block that will be created to replace
the existing block. This new block will not be shared by any other pipelines.

5. Click `Save and replace block`.
