## Adding a custom block to the pipeline

1. Create a new pipeline or open an existing pipeline.
1. Add a custom block by clicking on the `Custom` button from the list of block types available.
1. Specify the language for your block (Python and SQL currently supported)
  - For custom Python blocks, use the `@custom` decorator.
1. Specify the color for your block. The colors are a way to visually identify or organize your custom blocks (e.g. The block will have this color in the dependency tree.) and do not affect how they are run.
