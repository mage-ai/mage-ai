## Adding a markdown block to the pipeline

1. Create a new pipeline or open an existing pipeline.
2. Edit the pipeline.
3. Add a markdown block by clicking on the `Markdown` button from the list of block types available.
The `Markdown` button is visible at the bottom of the main section or when hovering over the divider between two blocks.
4. You can rearrange the blocks by clicking on the block header and dragging it to another position in the pipeline.

### Shortcuts
- Edit mode: Double-click the markdown block's content area to open the content editor. You can
also click the "Edit" icon in the block header to edit the content.
- Exit edit mode: Press `Escape` on your keyboard while the content editor is active.
You may need to press `Escape` twice, once to exit the editor and another time to deselect
the block. When the block is deselected, the editor will automatically close.

### Directory
The files associated with the markdown blocks are located in the `markdowns` directory
in the File Browser.

### Deleting a markdown block
When you delete a markdown block that is not used in any other pipeline,
the file may also be deleted automatically as well.
