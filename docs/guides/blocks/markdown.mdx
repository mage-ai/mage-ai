- Exit edit mode: Press `Escape` on your keyboard while the content editor is active.
You may need to press `Escape` twice, once to exit the editor and another time to deselect
the block. When the block is deselected, the editor will automatically close.

### Deleting a markdown block
When you delete a markdown block that is not used in any other pipeline,
the file may also be deleted automatically as well.
