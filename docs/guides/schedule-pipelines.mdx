You can schedule your pipeline to run on these intervals:

- Once
- Hourly
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Custom schedule using
  [CRON Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression)
- Every minute using CRON expression: `* * * * *`
- _Streaming pipeline_: coming soon

[schedule pipelines](/design/data-pipeline-management#create-trigger).

## Extra runtime variables from pipeline run

If your pipeline run belongs to a trigger that is scheduled, then the following extra
variables are available in your Python block’s keyword arguments (e.g. `kwargs`).

| Key | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `interval_start_datetime` | The `datetime` when the pipeline run is scheduled for. | `datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 23, 7, 0, 0, 0)` |
| `interval_end_datetime` | The `datetime` when the next pipeline run is scheduled for. | `datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 7, 0, 0, 0)` |
| `interval_seconds` | The number of seconds between the current pipeline run and the next pipeline run. | `86400` |
| `interval_start_datetime_previous` | The `datetime` when the previous pipeline run was scheduled for. | `datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 22, 7, 0, 0, 0)` |

### SQL block

If you’re using a SQL block, here is an example of how you can access these variables:

```sql
SELECT
    '{{ interval_start_datetime }}' AS interval_start_datetime
    , '{{ interval_end_datetime }}' AS interval_end_datetime
    , '{{ interval_seconds }}' AS interval_seconds
    , '{{ interval_start_datetime_previous }}' AS interval_start_datetime_previous
```
