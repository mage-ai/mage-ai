You can schedule your pipeline to run on these intervals:

- Once
- Hourly
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Custom schedule using
  [CRON Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression)
- Every minute using CRON expression: `* * * * *`
- _Streaming pipeline_: coming soon

---

Additional trigger settings:

* Skip run if previous run still in progress
  * Enabling this setting will tell the scheduler to not initialize the current run if any
    previous run for this trigger is still in progress.
