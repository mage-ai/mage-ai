<Warning>
  dbt integration is currently only supported when using Mage in
  [Docker](/getting-started/setup#using-docker) or in [Mage Pro](https://cloud.mage.ai/sign-up).

## What is Mage's dbt Integration?

Mage is a modern data pipeline tool that lets you **build, schedule, and monitor dbt models** alongside your data workflows — all in one platform. With Mage, you can fully automate your dbt workflows without using Airflow or dbt Cloud.

## Who Should Use dbt in Mage?

Mage’s dbt integration is designed for both analytics engineers and data engineers who want more control, flexibility, and observability in their data workflows.

### Analytics engineers

If you're transforming raw data into clean, analytics-ready datasets using dbt, Mage helps you:

- A **visual interface** to build and run dbt models
- The ability to **chain dbt steps** with Python or SQL blocks
- Easy scheduling and triggering for model runs
- **Live SQL previews** to speed up development

Mage empowers analytics teams to move faster, test confidently, and collaborate more effectively — all within a unified platform.

### Data engineers

If you're building and orchestrating production-grade data pipelines, Mage lets you:

- Run dbt models as part of larger **end-to-end workflows**
- Replace complex orchestration tools like **Airflow**
- Run dbt across environments — including **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, [**Mage Pro**](https://cloud.mage.ai), or in the **cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)**
- Monitor, debug, and get alerts on dbt runs with built-in **observability tools**

Mage simplifies pipeline orchestration and lets you focus on data logic — not infrastructure setup or maintenance.

## Key Features

### Schedule dbt model runs

Set dbt models to run:
- On a schedule
- When a file or event triggers
- From an API call or upstream task

This is perfect for productionizing your dbt workflows.

### Run specific dbt models and their dependencies

</Frame>

Use Mage’s visual interface to:
- Select and run individual dbt models
- Automatically include required dependencies

This saves time during development and debugging.

### Exclude Models When Running All

Need to run everything except one model? No problem. Mage lets you exclude specific dbt models in any run.

### Chain dbt Models with Other Tasks

Build workflows where dbt models run after:
- Pulling data from APIs
- Completing a Python or SQL block
- Finishing a different pipeline

You can treat dbt as a native building block in your DAG.

### Preview dbt model results as you write SQL

</Frame>

Mage lets you **preview dbt model output as you write SQL**, helping you test and iterate faster without running full pipelines.

### Build dynamic dbt pipelines using flexible variable interpolation

Take advantage of dynamic variable interpolation like:

- `{{ env_var('...') }}`
- `{{ variables('...') }}`
- `{{ mage_secret_var('...') }}`

### Automatically run dbt tests every time a pipeline runs

Mage will:
- Detect and run your dbt tests during each pipeline run
- Fail the pipeline if any dbt test fails

This enforces quality without extra setup.

### Built-In Monitoring and Alerting

Mage gives you full observability into your dbt runs:
- Track model run history
- See logs and SQL output
- Get alerts when models fail

You don’t need to wire up additional logging systems.
