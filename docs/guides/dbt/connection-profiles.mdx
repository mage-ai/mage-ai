Mage will look for a file named `profiles.yml` located in your dbt project root
folder.

For example, if your Mage project is named `demo_project` and your dbt project
name is `demo`, then your `profiles.yml` file for that dbt project should be
located in `demo_project/dbt/demo/profiles.yml`.

If you have a 2nd dbt project (e.g. named `example`), the connection profiles
for that project should be located in `demo_project/dbt/example/profiles.yml`.

For more information on how to configure your connection profiles, read
[dbtâ€™s documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started/connection-profiles).

Using Mage, you may also [interpolate variables](/dbt/variable-interpolation) in your connection profiles.

## How connection profiles are used

When you run a [single dbt model](/dbt/run-single-model) or
[selected dbt models](/dbt/run-selected-model), there is an input field labeled
`dbt profile target`. The value in that field will be the connection profile
target that Mage uses when running a dbt model block.

The command Mage executes is `dbt run` with the flag `--target` and the value of
that flag is the value from the input field labeled `dbt profile target`.
