## Overview

Mage Pro workspaces provide isolated environments for developing and managing data pipelines. Each workspace operates as a separate container instance, allowing for independent resource allocation and configuration management.

## Core Components

- Runtime Environment: Containerized Python environment
- Storage System: Persistent volume for code and data
- Resource Manager: Kubernetes-based resource allocation
- Access Control: Role-based permission system

<Note>
To utilize the collaborative workspace environment, please contact Mage to request an account upgrade. 
The Mage team will need to enable this feature for your organization.
</Note>

## Setup Guide

- **Step 1**: After logging into the Mage Pro environment you will be in the Workspaces interface (url: https://cluster.mage.ai/[cluster-uuid]/manage). Press the Create new workspace button.
- **Step 2**:  Give the workspace a name.
- **Step 3**: Click the dropdown arrow and toggle on the Kubernetes configuration if you need to custom configure your Kubernetes container. (see Kubernetes container configuration section for more details).
- **Step 4**: Click the Lifecycle (optional) dropdown to create lifecycle management policies (see Lifecycle management policies section for more information).
- **Step 5**: Click the create button and wait a few minutes for your workspace to start.
- **Step 6**: Once your workspace is running, click the workspace open button under the open column in the workspace management interface.

## Workspace Configuration Options

Mage Pro workspaces support comprehensive configuration options that allow you to customize your workspace environment, resources, and behavior. Configuration options vary by cluster type (Kubernetes, Docker).

### Basic Workspace Configuration

All workspace types support these basic fields:

- **`name`** (required): The workspace name. Must be unique within your cluster.
- **`lifecycle_config`** (optional): Lifecycle management policies (see [Lifecycle Management Policies](#lifecycle-management-policies-optional) section below).

### Kubernetes Workspace Configuration

Kubernetes workspaces support the following configuration options:

#### Container Configuration (YAML)

The `container_config` field accepts a YAML string that allows you to configure:

1. **Resource Configuration**: Controls memory and CPU allocation for your workspace container
2. **Environment Variables**: Customize environment variables for your workspace
3. **Other Container Settings**: Any other Kubernetes container configuration options

These settings help maintain workspace stability and ensure proper resource allocation for development tasks.

### Environment configuration

#### Setting `USER_CODE_PATH`

If you've modified the default `USER_CODE_PATH` environment variable in the base project (Mage Pro management portal), update your Kubernetes configuration:

```yaml
env:
  - name: USER_CODE_PATH
    value: /home/src/<path_to_folder>
```

This environment variable tells your workspace where to find your project code.

#### Adding Other Environment Variables
You can define additional environment variables in the same env section to further configure your workspace:

```yaml
env:
  - name: USER_CODE_PATH
    value: /home/src/<your_project_folder>
  - name: ENV
    value: dev
  - name: TS_AUTHKEY
    value: <your_tailscale_auth_key>
  - name: TS_EXTRA_ARGS
    value: --accept-routes
```

### Resource configuration (optional)

**Optionally** configure your workspace's computing resources in Kubernetes:

```yaml
resources:
  requests: # Minimum resources guaranteed
    memory: "2Gi" # 2 gigabytes of RAM
    cpu: "1" # 1 full CPU core
  limits: # Maximum resources allowed
    memory: "4Gi" # 4 gigabytes RAM ceiling
    cpu: "2" # Can use up to 2 CPU cores
```

This configuration ensures your workspace has adequate resources for development while preventing resource overconsumption. The requests represent guaranteed minimums, while limits prevent your workspace from using more than its allocated share.

#### Complete Kubernetes Container Configuration Example

Here's a complete example of a Kubernetes `container_config` YAML:

```yaml
env:
  - name: USER_CODE_PATH
    value: /home/src/<path_to_folder>
  - name: ENV
    value: dev
  - name: TS_AUTHKEY
    value: <your_tailscale_auth_key>
  - name: TS_EXTRA_ARGS
    value: --accept-routes

resources:
  requests: # Minimum resources guaranteed
    memory: "2Gi" # 2 gigabytes of RAM
    cpu: "1" # 1 full CPU core
  limits: # Maximum resources allowed
    memory: "4Gi" # 4 gigabytes RAM ceiling
    cpu: "2" # Can use up to 2 CPU cores
```

**Resource Configuration Details:**
- **`requests`**: Minimum resources guaranteed to your workspace. Kubernetes will ensure these resources are available.
- **`limits`**: Maximum resources your workspace can use. Prevents resource overconsumption and ensures fair resource allocation across workspaces.

**Note**: You can include any valid Kubernetes container configuration in the `container_config` YAML, including:
- Environment variables (`env`)
- Resource requests and limits (`resources`)
- Volume mounts (`volumeMounts`)
- Security context (`securityContext`)
- And other Kubernetes container spec fields

## Share secrets across workspaces

To share secrets across different workspaces developers need to create a custom environment variable 
called `SHARE_SECRETS_ACROSS_WORKSPACES` then set the value to `1` to enable this feature. This will 
allow developers to share their secrets across different workspaces within a cluster.

        />
    </p>

## Inherit environment variables

Configuring your Mage Pro workspaces to inherit the main cluster’s environment 
variables is essential for efficiently configuring your workspace container. 
The following options allow you to control how variables are shared within your environment.


To enable environment variable inheritance in workspaces, you must set:

```bash
INHERIT_ENV_VARS=1
```

This applies to **both Managed Cloud** and **Self-hosted Mage Pro**.


### Managed Cloud
The USER_DEFINED_VARS environment variable lets you control which environment variables are inherited by workspaces.
It accepts a comma-separated list of variable names, giving you flexibility to include only the configuration values you need across workspaces.

- If `USER_DEFINED_VARS` is **not set**: all environment variables will be inherited automatically.
- If `USER_DEFINED_VARS` is **set**: only the specified variables will be inherited.

**Example – inherit specific variables:**
```bash
USER_DEFINED_VARS=VAR1,VAR2
```

**Example – inherit by pattern (wildcard/regex):**
```bash
USER_DEFINED_VARS=DEV_ENV_*
```
This will inherit all environment variables matching the pattern (e.g., any starting with `DEV_ENV_*`).

### Self-hosted Mage Pro (Hybrid Cloud, Private Cloud, On-prem)
You **must** set `USER_DEFINED_VARS` to define which variables to inherit:
```bash
USER_DEFINED_VARS=VAR1,VAR2
```
Wildcard/regex-style patterns are supported here as well.


### Inherit variables by workspace environment (new)
You can define inheritance rules per workspace environment using the `ENV` variable:

```bash
USER_DEFINED_VARS__ENV__{env_value}={pattern}
```

- `{env_value}`: value of the `ENV` variable in the workspace.
- `{pattern}`: wildcard/regex pattern for matching variables.

**Example:**
```bash
USER_DEFINED_VARS__ENV__dev=DEV_ENV_*
```
Any workspace with `ENV=dev` inherits all variables matching `DEV_ENV_*`.


### Updating workspaces after environment variable changes

When you add or modify environment variables in your base cluster, existing workspaces will not automatically inherit these changes. To ensure your workspaces reflect the updated environment configuration, you must restart the affected workspaces.

To update a workspace:

1. Open the workspace settings by clicking into the workspace you want to update
2. Click the update button for your workspace
<Frame>
    <p align="center">
        <img
            alt="Update workspace button"
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mage-ai/assets/main/guides/workspaces/update-workspace-button.png"
        />
    </p>
</Frame>
3. Click the dropdown arrow on the Kubernetes configuration section
4. Toggle the "update workspace settings" option to true
5. Click update
<Frame>
    <p align="center">
        <img
            alt="Update workspace configuration"
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mage-ai/assets/main/guides/workspaces/workspace-update-configuration-2.png"
        />
    </p>
</Frame>
The container will take up to several minutes to update and restart with the new environment configuration.

## Lifecycle Management Policies (Optional)

Mage Pro workspaces support various lifecycle management policies that control how your workspace behaves throughout its runtime. These policies include automated termination settings, pre-initialization scripts, and post-initialization procedures, giving you complete control over your workspace's behavior from startup to shutdown.

Lifecycle configuration is specified in the `lifecycle_config` field as a YAML object:

```yaml
termination_policy:
  enable_auto_termination: true
  max_idle_seconds: 1800
pre_start_script_path: /path/to/script.sh
post_start:
  command: ["echo", "Workspace started"]
  hook_path: /path/to/hook.sh
```

### Termination Policy

The termination policy controls how your workspace shuts down when inactive.

**Configuration:**
- **`enable_auto_termination`** (boolean): Enable or disable automatic termination. Defaults to `false`.
- **`max_idle_seconds`** (integer): The number of seconds of inactivity before the workspace is automatically terminated. The idle time is measured in seconds, and you can set this duration based on your needs. For example:
  - `1800` seconds = 30 minutes
  - `3600` seconds = 1 hour
  - `7200` seconds = 2 hours

**Example:**
```yaml
termination_policy:
  enable_auto_termination: true
  max_idle_seconds: 1800
```

### Pre-Start Scripts

Pre-start scripts run before your workspace container is initialized. These scripts must include a `get_custom_configs` method that returns a dictionary of configurations. This is where you can set up environment variables, modify container configurations, and prepare any necessary resources. The script executes before any workspace services start, making it ideal for initial setup and configuration tasks.

**Configuration:**
- **`pre_start_script_path`** (string): Path to the pre-start script. Can be:
  - Absolute path: `/absolute/path/to/script.sh`
  - Relative path: `scripts/pre_start.sh` (relative to the root project directory)

**Example:**
```yaml
pre_start_script_path: /home/src/scripts/setup_workspace.sh
```

### Post-Start Scripts

Post-start scripts execute after your workspace is fully initialized and running. You can specify either a direct command or provide a path to a script for more complex procedures. These scripts are typically used for starting services, performing health checks, or completing any additional setup tasks that require the workspace to be fully operational.

**Configuration:**
- **`post_start.command`** (array of strings): Direct command to execute. Example: `["echo", "Workspace started"]`
- **`post_start.hook_path`** (string): Path to a script file. Can be:
  - Absolute path: `/absolute/path/to/hook.sh`
  - Relative path: `scripts/post_start.sh` (relative to the root project directory)

**Note**: You can specify either `command` or `hook_path`, or both. If both are specified, the command will execute first, followed by the hook script.

**Example 1: Single post-start command**
```yaml
post_start:
  command: ["echo", "Workspace started"]
```

**Example 2: Multiple post-start commands using a script**
```yaml
post_start:
  hook_path: /home/src/scripts/post_start.sh
```

Where `post_start.sh` contains multiple commands:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting service 1..."
service1 start

echo "Starting service 2..."
service2 start
```

**Example 3: Two post-start commands using command array with shell**
```yaml
post_start:
  command: ["sh", "-c", "echo 'Command 1' && service1 start && echo 'Command 2' && service2 start"]
```

**Example 4: Command and hook script (command runs first, then hook)**
```yaml
post_start:
  command: ["echo", "Workspace started"]
  hook_path: /home/src/scripts/start_services.sh
```

## Setting workspaces for self-hosted Mage Pro cluster

<Note>
This section applies to **self-hosted Mage Pro clusters** only. These configurations are not applicable to Managed Cloud deployments.
</Note>

### Workspace Configuration Environment Variables

These environment variables are set at the **cluster level** to configure default workspace behavior. They control how workspaces are created, what storage they use, and how they're exposed via ingress.

#### Ingress Configuration

- **`WORKSPACE_INGRESS_NAME`** (optional): Name of the Kubernetes ingress resource to use for workspaces. Defaults to the cluster UUID (`MAGE_CLUSTER_UUID`). If not set, workspaces will be accessible through the service directly rather than via ingress.

- **`WORKSPACE_INGRESS_TYPE`** (optional): Type of ingress controller to use. Supported values:
  - `nginx` (default): Use NGINX ingress controller
  - `alb`: Use AWS Application Load Balancer ingress
  - `istio`: Use Istio ingress gateway

  Default: `nginx`

- **`WORKSPACE_INGRESS_PATH_TYPE`** (optional): Path type for ingress paths. Supported values:
  - `ImplementationSpecific` (default): Path matching is implementation-specific
  - `Prefix`: Path must match as a prefix

  Default: `ImplementationSpecific`

#### Storage Configuration

You can configure workspace storage in one of two ways:

##### Option 1: Individual PVCs per Workspace (using WORKSPACE_STORAGE_CLASS)

- **`WORKSPACE_STORAGE_CLASS`** (optional): Kubernetes storage class name to use for workspace persistent volumes. When configured, each workspace will create its own PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) using this storage class.

  Default: `efs-sc-us-west-2`

  **Use case**: When you want each workspace to have its own isolated storage volume.

##### Option 2: Shared PVC across Workspaces (using WORKSPACE_PVC_NAME + WORKSPACE_PVC_SUBPATH_PREFIX)

- **`WORKSPACE_PVC_NAME`** (optional): Name of an existing PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to share across all workspaces. When set, all workspaces will use this shared PVC instead of creating individual PVCs.

- **`WORKSPACE_PVC_SUBPATH_PREFIX`** (optional): Prefix for subpaths when using a shared PVC. Each workspace will use a separate subfolder under this prefix to isolate its data. **Required** when `WORKSPACE_PVC_NAME` is set.

  **Example**: If `WORKSPACE_PVC_SUBPATH_PREFIX=workspaces`, a workspace named `my-workspace` will use the subpath `workspaces/my-workspace`.

  **Use case**: When you want to share storage across multiple workspaces and manage storage more efficiently.

**Important**: Configure either `WORKSPACE_STORAGE_CLASS` (for individual PVCs) or `WORKSPACE_PVC_NAME` + `WORKSPACE_PVC_SUBPATH_PREFIX` (for shared PVC), but not both. If both are configured, the shared PVC option takes precedence.

#### Pod Configuration

- **`INHERIT_POD_ANNOTATIONS`** (optional, boolean): If `true`, workspace pods will inherit annotations from the main cluster pod. This is useful for passing through annotations like Prometheus scraping labels, service mesh configuration, etc.

  Default: `false`

#### Example Configuration

**Example 1: Individual PVCs per workspace**
```bash
# Ingress configuration
export WORKSPACE_INGRESS_NAME=my-cluster-ingress
export WORKSPACE_INGRESS_TYPE=nginx
export WORKSPACE_INGRESS_PATH_TYPE=Prefix

# Storage configuration - each workspace gets its own PVC
export WORKSPACE_STORAGE_CLASS=fast-ssd

# Pod configuration
export INHERIT_POD_ANNOTATIONS=true
```

**Example 2: Shared PVC across workspaces**
```bash
# Ingress configuration
export WORKSPACE_INGRESS_NAME=my-cluster-ingress
export WORKSPACE_INGRESS_TYPE=nginx
export WORKSPACE_INGRESS_PATH_TYPE=Prefix

# Storage configuration - all workspaces share one PVC with separate subfolders
export WORKSPACE_PVC_NAME=shared-workspace-storage
export WORKSPACE_PVC_SUBPATH_PREFIX=workspaces

# Pod configuration
export INHERIT_POD_ANNOTATIONS=true
```

**Note**: These environment variables are set on the **main cluster container**, not on individual workspaces. They control the default behavior when creating new workspaces. Individual workspaces can override some of these settings (like storage class) in their own configuration.

### Docker Workspace Configuration

Docker workspaces support additional configuration options specific to Docker containers:

#### Docker Workspace Environment Variables

These environment variables are set at the **cluster level** to configure default Docker workspace behavior:

- **`DOCKER_HOST`** (optional): Docker daemon host. Defaults to `unix://var/run/docker.sock`.
- **`DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY`** (optional): Enable TLS verification for Docker connection. Set to `1` to enable, `0` to disable. Defaults to `0`.
- **`DOCKER_CERT_PATH`** (optional): Path to TLS certificates for Docker connection.
- **`DOCKER_SWARM_MODE`** (optional): Enable or disable Docker Swarm mode. Set to `1` to enable, `0` to disable. Defaults to `0`.

**Note**: These environment variables are set on the **main cluster container**, not on individual workspaces. They control the default behavior when creating new Docker workspaces. Individual workspaces can override these settings in their own configuration.

#### Docker Container Configuration (YAML)

Similar to Kubernetes, Docker workspaces support a `container_config` YAML string:

**Example Docker Workspace Configuration:**
```yaml
image: mage-pro:version
volumes:
  /host/path:
    bind: /home/src
    mode: rw
environment:
  TEST_ENV_VAR: "1"
public_url: mage.example.com/test1
```

**Note**: For Docker workspaces, the `container_config` field is the primary way to configure image, volumes, and environment. The system will parse this YAML string and extract:
- `image`: Docker image to use
- `volumes`: Volume mounts configuration
- `environment`: Environment variables
- `public_url`: Public URL for the workspace

## Global Roles

Users can be assigned global roles that apply across all workspaces within your Mage Pro environment. Global role assignment is managed by project administrators through Users tab in left navigation menu located in the main project interface.

## Workspace-Specific Roles

Individual workspaces can have unique role settings. Workspace owners can:

- Assign user roles specific to their workspace
- Modify existing role assignments
- Remove user access to their workspace

Understanding and properly configuring your Mage Pro workspaces is essential for efficient data pipeline development and management. With the right combination of resource allocation, lifecycle policies, and user permissions, you can create a stable and secure environment tailored to your project's needs.
