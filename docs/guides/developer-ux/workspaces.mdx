## Overview

Mage Pro workspaces provide isolated environments for developing and managing data pipelines. Each workspace operates as a separate container instance, allowing for independent resource allocation and configuration management.

## Core Components

- Runtime Environment: Containerized Python environment
- Storage System: Persistent volume for code and data
- Resource Manager: Kubernetes-based resource allocation
- Access Control: Role-based permission system

<Note>
To utilize the collaborative workspace environment, please contact Mage to request an account upgrade. 
The Mage team will need to enable this feature for your organization.
</Note>

## Setup Guide

- **Step 1**: After logging into the Mage Pro environment you will be in the Workspaces interface (url: https://cluster.mage.ai/[cluster-uuid]/manage). Press the Create new workspace button.
- **Step 2**:  Give the workspace a name.
- **Step 3**: Click the dropdown arrow and toggle on the Kubernetes configuration if you need to custom configure your Kubernetes container. (see Kubernetes container configuration section for more details).
- **Step 4**: Click the Lifecycle (optional) dropdown to create lifecycle management policies (see Lifecycle management policies section for more information).
- **Step 4**: Click the create button and wait a few minutes for your workspace to start.
- **Step 5**: Once your workspace is running, click the workspace open button under the open column in the workspace management interface.

## Kubernetes container configuration

Kubernetes provides a robust container orchestration system for managing your workspace resources and environment. The configuration above covers two key aspects:

1. Resource Configuration: Controls memory and CPU allocation for your workspace container, with both minimum guarantees and upper limits to ensure stable performance.
2. Environment Configuration: Enables customization of environment variables, specifically the project code location if you've modified it from the default path.

These settings help maintain workspace stability and ensure proper resource allocation for development tasks.

### Environment configuration

#### Setting `USER_CODE_PATH`

If you've modified the default `USER_CODE_PATH` environment variable in the base project (Mage Pro management portal), update your Kubernetes configuration:

```yaml
env:
  - name: USER_CODE_PATH
    value: /home/src/<path_to_folder>
```

This environment variable tells your workspace where to find your project code.

#### Adding Other Environment Variables
You can define additional environment variables in the same env section to further configure your workspace:

```yaml
env:
  - name: USER_CODE_PATH
    value: /home/src/<your_project_folder>
  - name: ENV
    value: dev
  - name: TS_AUTHKEY
    value: <your_tailscale_auth_key>
  - name: TS_EXTRA_ARGS
    value: --accept-routes
```

### Resource configuration (optional)

**Optionally** configure your workspace's computing resources in Kubernetes:

```yaml
resources:
  requests: # Minimum resources guaranteed
    memory: "2Gi" # 2 gigabytes of RAM
    cpu: "1" # 1 full CPU core
  limits: # Maximum resources allowed
    memory: "4Gi" # 4 gigabytes RAM ceiling
    cpu: "2" # Can use up to 2 CPU cores
```

This configuration ensures your workspace has adequate resources for development while preventing resource overconsumption. The requests represent guaranteed minimums, while limits prevent your workspace from using more than its allocated share.

## Share secrets across workspaces

To share secrets across different workspaces developers need to create a custom environment variable 
called `SHARE_SECRETS_ACROSS_WORKSPACES` then set the value to `1` to enable this feature. This will 
allow developers to share their secrets across different workspaces within a cluster.

## Inherit environment variables

Configuring your Mage Pro workspaces to inherit the main cluster’s environment 
variables is essential for efficiently configuring your workspace container. 
The following options allow you to control how variables are shared within your environment.


To enable environment variable inheritance in workspaces, you must set:

```bash
INHERIT_ENV_VARS=1
```

This applies to **both Managed Cloud** and **Self-hosted Mage Pro**.


### Managed Cloud
The USER_DEFINED_VARS environment variable lets you control which environment variables are inherited by workspaces.
It accepts a comma-separated list of variable names, giving you flexibility to include only the configuration values you need across workspaces.

- If `USER_DEFINED_VARS` is **not set**: all environment variables will be inherited automatically.
- If `USER_DEFINED_VARS` is **set**: only the specified variables will be inherited.

**Example – inherit specific variables:**
```bash
USER_DEFINED_VARS=VAR1,VAR2
```

**Example – inherit by pattern (wildcard/regex):**
```bash
USER_DEFINED_VARS=DEV_ENV_*
```
This will inherit all environment variables matching the pattern (e.g., any starting with `DEV_ENV_*`).

### Self-hosted Mage Pro (Hybrid Cloud, Private Cloud, On-prem)
You **must** set `USER_DEFINED_VARS` to define which variables to inherit:
```bash
USER_DEFINED_VARS=VAR1,VAR2
```
Wildcard/regex-style patterns are supported here as well.


### Inherit variables by workspace environment (new)
You can define inheritance rules per workspace environment using the `ENV` variable:

```bash
USER_DEFINED_VARS__ENV__{env_value}={pattern}
```

- `{env_value}`: value of the `ENV` variable in the workspace.
- `{pattern}`: wildcard/regex pattern for matching variables.

**Example:**
```bash
USER_DEFINED_VARS__ENV__dev=DEV_ENV_*
```
Any workspace with `ENV=dev` inherits all variables matching `DEV_ENV_*`.


### Updating workspaces after environment variable changes

When you add or modify environment variables in your base cluster, existing workspaces will not automatically inherit these changes. To ensure your workspaces reflect the updated environment configuration, you must restart the affected workspaces.

To update a workspace:

1. Open the workspace settings by clicking into the workspace you want to update
2. Click the update button for your workspace

        />
    </p>
</Frame>
3. Click the dropdown arrow on the Kubernetes configuration section
4. Toggle the "update workspace settings" option to true
5. Click update

    <p align="center">
        <img

        />
    </p>
</Frame>
The container will take up to several minutes to update and restart with the new environment configuration.

## Lifecycle management policies (optional)

Mage Pro workspaces support various lifecycle management policies that control how your workspace behaves throughout its runtime. These policies include automated termination settings, pre-initialization scripts, and post-initialization procedures, giving you complete control over your workspace's behavior from startup to shutdown.

### Termination Policy

The termination policy controls how your workspace shuts down when inactive. You can enable auto-termination, which will automatically shut down your workspace after a specified period of inactivity. The idle time is measured in seconds, and you can set this duration based on your needs. For example, you might set it to 1800 seconds (30 minutes) or 3600 seconds (1 hour).

### Pre-Start Scripts

Pre-start scripts run before your workspace container is initialized. These scripts must include a `get_custom_configs` method that returns a dictionary of configurations. This is where you can set up environment variables, modify container configurations, and prepare any necessary resources. The script executes before any workspace services start, making it ideal for initial setup and configuration tasks.

### Post-Start Scripts

Post-start scripts execute after your workspace is fully initialized and running. You can specify either a direct command or provide a path to a script for more complex procedures. These scripts are typically used for starting services, performing health checks, or completing any additional setup tasks that require the workspace to be fully operational.

## Global Roles

Users can be assigned global roles that apply across all workspaces within your Mage Pro environment. Global role assignment is managed by project administrators through Users tab in left navigation menu located in the main project interface.

## Workspace-Specific Roles

Individual workspaces can have unique role settings. Workspace owners can:

- Assign user roles specific to their workspace
- Modify existing role assignments
- Remove user access to their workspace

Understanding and properly configuring your Mage Pro workspaces is essential for efficient data pipeline development and management. With the right combination of resource allocation, lifecycle policies, and user permissions, you can create a stable and secure environment tailored to your project's needs.
