## Adding blocks made easy

You can quickly add blocks of code to your pipeline with these methods:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Drag blocks from the file browser and drop it on the pipeline" icon="dragon" iconType="duotone" defaultOpen>
        <Note>
            **Supported block type directories:** `callbacks`, `conditionals`, `custom`, `data_exporters`, `data_loaders`, `dbt`,
            `dbts`, `markdowns`, `scratchpads`, `sensors`, and `transformers`

            Version 0.9.64 or greater is required to add `callback` and `conditional`
            blocks from the file browser.
        </Note>

        1. Open the file browser on the Pipeline Editor page.
        1. Click a block file and keep holding down.
        1. Drag the block file onto the center of the page (the Notebook area).
        1. Release the button and it’ll be added to the pipeline.

                />
            </p>
        </Frame>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Search blocks across entire projects" icon="searchengin" iconType="duotone">
        Find existing code and add it to the current pipeline.

        <Note>
            You must first enable the feature named <b>Add new block v2</b> in your
            [project settings](http://localhost:6789/settings/workspace/preferences).
            This feature is available in standard (batch) pipelines.

            If you just recently enabled the feature <b>Add new block v2</b>, you must restart Mage
            so that your blocks can be indexed.

            Version 0.9.64 or greater is required to add `callback` and `conditional`
            blocks from the block search.
        </Note>

        Instead of clicking a button to add a new block, type in the search bar to find an
        existing block across all your projects.

        <Tip>
            ⌘ + / (Command + Forward Slash) keyboard shortcut will instantly focus your typing on the
            search bar from anywhere on the page (as long as you aren’t already typing in a
            block of code).

    <Accordion title="Custom code templates for reducing boilerplate work" icon="cauldron" iconType="duotone">
        Create a template for a block or a pipeline that can be reused throughout your project.

## Re-arrange and hide or show blocks

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Re-arrange the order of blocks" icon="send-back" iconType="duotone" defaultOpen>
        Drag a block and move it up or down by dropping it on another block.

        <Frame>
            <p align="center">

        </Frame>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Show blocks in current pipeline" icon="user-secret" iconType="duotone">
        When editing a pipeline, you can switch the file browser view to show only the blocks in the
        current pipeline.

        After toggling this view, you can select which blocks to collapse and which to expand.
        This can help optimize vertical screen space while writing code.

Sync data from 3rd party sources without writing boilerplate code by using pre-built
data integrations (Singer Taps and Targets) provided by the data engineering community.

<Tip>
    Data integrations to sync your data to 3rd party destinations are also available in the
    same feature set.
</Tip>

<Tip>
    These sources and destinations can be combined and chained together with
    your existing blocks.

## Add new block v2

An improved experience for adding new blocks to your pipeline in the
Pipeline Editor (`/pipelines/[pipeline_uuid]/edit`), which allows you to
search for existing block files and use data integration blocks inside of
a standard (batch) pipeline.
