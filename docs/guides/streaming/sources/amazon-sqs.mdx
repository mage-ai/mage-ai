title: "Amazon SQS"
---

## Config

```yaml
connector_type: amazon_sqs
queue_name: test-queue
batch_size: 10
wait_time_seconds: 1
message_deletion_method: AFTER_RECEIVED   # AFTER_RECEIVED or MANNUAL

serde_config:
  serialization_method: JSON
```

## Authentication
Here are the options to authenticate with the AWS SQS.
1. Add the following keys and values to your environment variables
  * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  * `AWS_REGION`
2. If you deploy Mage on AWS ECS cluster, you can use ECS execution task role to authenticate.
   You can grant the ECS task permissions to access other AWS services by attaching IAM policies
   to this ECS task execution role.

If you get the `botocore.exceptions.NoRegionError` error, try setting the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
environment variable.

## Pass raw message to transformer

```yaml
serde_config:
  serialization_method: RAW_VALUE
```

## Message deletion method

We support two ways to delete messages:
1. Delete the message in the data loader automatically after deserializing the message body.
    * Set `message_deletion_method: AFTER_RECEIVED` in the source config.
    * The input of the transformer is the list of deserialized message body.
1. Manually delete the message in transformer after processing the message.
    * Set `message_deletion_method: MANNUAL` in the source config.
    * The input of the transformer is the list of dictionary with the structure
      ```python
      {
        'parsed_msg_body': {'k1': 'v1', ...},
        'raw_message': sqs.Message(...)
      }
      ```

      You can use the following example code to process the message and delete it after.
      ```python
      @transformer
      def transform(messages: List[Dict], *args, **kwargs):
          processed_msgs = []
          for msg in messages:
              processed_msg = msg['parsed_msg_body']
              # Add your own logic to process the message
              processed_msgs.append(processed_msg)
              msg['raw_message'].delete()
          return processed_msgs
      ```
