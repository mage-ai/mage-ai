description: This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using ActiveMQ with Mage for streaming data pipelines.
---

### Step 1: Create a new streaming pipeline

1. Open Mage in your browser.
2. Click on "+ New Pipeline" and select "Streaming".
3. Give your pipeline a name and click "Create".

### Step 2: Add an ActiveMQ data loader

1. In your new pipeline, click "+ Add Block" and select "Data loader".
2. Choose "ActiveMQ" as the data source.

### Step 3: Configure your ActiveMQ connection

In the data loader block, use the following YAML configuration as a template:

```yaml
connector_type: 'activemq'
connection_host: 'localhost'
connection_port: 61613
queue_name: 'default'
username: 'admin'
password: 'admin'
```
Adjust these values according to your ActiveMQ setup:

- `connection_host`: Your ActiveMQ broker's hostname or IP address.
- `connection_port`: The port your ActiveMQ broker is listening on (default STOMP port is 61613).
- `queue_name`: The name of the queue you want to consume messages from.
- `username` and `password`: Your ActiveMQ authentication credentials.
<Note>
Ensure that the stomp port on ActiveMQ is open, which is 61613 by default.
</Note>

### Step 4: Additional configuration (optional)

Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to add additional configuration options:

1. For SSL/TLS connections:
```YAML
use_ssl: true
ssl_cert_path: '/path/to/cert.pem'
ssl_key_path: '/path/to/key.pem'
```
2. To set a connection timeout:
```YAML
connection_timeout: 30 # in seconds
```
3. To control message prefetching:
```YAML
prefetch_size: 100
```
### Step 5: Test your connection

1. Save your data loader block.
2. Click the "Test" button to verify your connection to ActiveMQ.
3. If successful, you should see a sample of messages from your queue.
