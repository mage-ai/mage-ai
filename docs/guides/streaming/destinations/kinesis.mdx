## Config

```yaml
connector_type: kinesis
stream_name: stream_name
partition_key: key
```

- **partition_key**: A partition key is used to group data by shard within a stream. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records belonging to a stream into multiple shards. It uses the partition key that is associated with each data record to determine which shard a given data record belongs to.
