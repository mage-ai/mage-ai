## Basic config

```yaml
connector_type: amazon_s3
bucket: bucket
prefix: prefix
file_type: parquet
buffer_size_mb: 5
buffer_timeout_seconds: 300
```

* `bucket`: The S3 bucket you want to use to store the data.
* `prefix`: The S3 path prefix. The whole S3 path will be `s3://{bucket}/{prefix}`.
* `file_type`: `parquet` or `csv`
* `buffer_size_mb` and `buffer_timeout_seconds`: Mage puts messages in a buffer before uploading to S3.
  You can configure the size and timeout of the buffer to control the file size and the delay.

## Configure time-based partition

```yaml
date_partition_format: "%Y%m%dT%H"

```

If you want to store the S3 data in time-based paratition folders. You can add `date_partition_format`
to the config. Example values: `%Y%m%d`, `%Y%m%dT%H`.


## Authentication
Here are the options to authenticate with the AWS S3 bucket.
1. Add the following keys and values to your environment variables
  * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  * `AWS_REGION`
2. If you deploy Mage on AWS ECS cluster, you can use ECS execution task role to authenticate.
   You can grant the ECS task permissions to access other AWS services by attaching IAM policies
   to this ECS task execution role.
