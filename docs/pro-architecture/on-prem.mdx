## Deployment options

Mage Pro supports two modes of on-prem deployment. The Mage team will provide all necessary deliverables and installation support.

### 1. Kubernetes cluster

Run Mage Pro in your own on-prem Kubernetes cluster for production-grade orchestration and scalability. This includes Kubernetes distributions such as **Red Hat OpenShift**, Rancher, or other enterprise Kubernetes platforms.

**Deliverables from Mage**:
- Helm chart(s) pre-configured for Mage Pro (control plane, scheduler, and executor pods)
- Docker image (if your environment does not have internet access) **or** secure registry credentials to pull the image (if your cluster has network access)
- Configuration templates for networking, secrets, monitoring, and scaling
- Documentation and best practices for integrating with your Kubernetes environment

**Highlights**:
- Pod-level isolation for workspaces and jobs
- Leverage Kubernetes-native scaling, security, and monitoring
- Recommended for enterprise-grade, multi-team deployments

### 2. Docker

For environments without Kubernetes, Mage Pro can be deployed directly on Docker. This simplifies setup while still providing workspace/job isolation using containers.

**Deliverables from Mage**:
- Docker images for Mage Pro services
  - Air-gapped environments (no internet): Mage team provides image files directly
  - Connected environments: Mage team provides secure registry credentials to pull images
- Docker Compose file with all required configuration

**Highlights**:
- Quick and easy installation with minimal infrastructure requirements
- Run the Mage Pro control plane in a long-running Docker container
- Option to run pipeline jobs in separate, short-lived containers (for isolation) or locally within the same container process (Pro-only feature)
- Workspaces can also run in their own dedicated containers (Pro-only feature)
- Ideal for smaller teams or environments without Kubernetes

## License key

A valid **Mage Pro license key** is required for all on-prem deployments.
- The license key is provided when you purchase Mage Pro.
- It must be included in your deployment configuration (Kubernetes or Docker) before the server will start.
- License keys can be rotated at any time without downtime.

## Benefits

- **Maximum security**: All services and data stay within your on-prem environment.
- **Flexibility**: Choose between Kubernetes (e.g., OpenShift) or Docker depending on your infra maturity.
- **Consistency**: Same Mage Pro features and workspace management UI across deployment modes.
