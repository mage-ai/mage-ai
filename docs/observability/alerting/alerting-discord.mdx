## Set up webhooks for Discord

Follow these
[instructions on Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
to setup incoming webhooks for your workspace.

---

## Update Mage project settings

Once you’ve set up webhooks for Discord, you should have a webhook URL that Discord
provides.

Here is an example webhook (yours may vary):

```
https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/XXX3514XXXXX/MHhahaduwa183-ccgfxcgv88kladJkjBJKB78CHCfds
```

Follow these steps to add that webhook URL to your project settings:

1. Open the Mage tool in your browser (e.g. http://localhost:6789/).
2. Open a pipeline and start editing it (e.g.
   http://localhost:6789/pipelines/example_pipeline/edit).
3. In your left sidebar in the file browser, scroll all the way down and click
   on a file named `metadata.yaml`.
4. In the `metadata.yaml` file, add a section with the following
   configuration or update the existing `notification_config` section:

    ```yaml
    notification_config:
      alert_on:
        - trigger_failure
        - trigger_passed_sla
    ```

    If you omit the `alert_on` section it will default to `trigger_failure` and `trigger_passed_sla`.

    Options:

    - `trigger_failure`: alert when a run of a trigger fails
    - `trigger_success`: alert when a run of a trigger succeeds
    - `trigger_passed_sla`: alert when a SLA is missed.
      - In this context, SLA (Service Level Agreement) is an expected amount of time for the pipeline to complete.
      - If the pipeline runs _longer_ than the SLA, an alert will be sent.

5. In the `metadata.yaml` file, add the following values:

    ```yaml
    notification_config:
      alert_on:
        ...
      discord_config:
        webhook_url: ...
    ```

    Change the `webhook_url` value to be the webhook URL you created from Discord.

## Customize message templates
You can customize message templates in `notification_config`. Here is an example config:
```yaml
notification_config:
  alert_on:
    ...
  discord_config:
    ...
  message_templates:
    failure:
      title: 'Failed to execute pipeline {pipeline_uuid} at {execution_time}'
      summary: >
        Failed to execute pipeline {pipeline_run_url}.
        Pipeline uuid: {pipeline_uuid}. Trigger name: {pipeline_schedule_name}.
        Test custom message.
    success:
      title: ...
      summary: ...
    passed_sla:
      title: ...
      summary: ...
```
You can customize the message template for `success`, `failure`, `passed_sla` scenarios. For each message template,
you can specify the sentence on `summary` and the `title`.

To interpolate variables in the message template, you can use `{variable_name}` syntax.
Here are the supported variables:
1. `execution_time`
1. `pipeline_run_url`
1. `pipeline_schedule_id`
1. `pipeline_schedule_name`
1. `pipeline_schedule_description`
1. `pipeline_uuid`
1. `error`
    * available only for the `failure` message template
1. `stacktrace`
    * available only for the `failure` message template

> **Note**: For `pipeline_run_url`, the default host is `http://localhost:6789`. You can specify `MAGE_PUBLIC_HOST` to be
the host url you want to use in the notification messages.

### 🚀 Pro Only: Interpolate Mage Variables in Message Templates

import { ProButton } from '/snippets/pro/button.mdx';
import { ProOnly } from '/snippets/pro/only.mdx';

<ProOnly source="notification" />

If you're using **Mage Pro**, you can interpolate environment variables and other [Mage variables](/development/variables/referencing-variables#accessing-variables-in-mage) directly in your Discord message templates using the familiar Jinja-like syntax:

```yaml
notification_config:
  message_templates:
    failure:
      details: >
        Failed at {{ env_var('ENVIRONMENT') }} environment.
        Pipeline run: {pipeline_run_url}.
```

In addition to the variables mentioned above (e.g. `execution_time`, `pipeline_uuid`, etc), you can also use the
following in your message templates in Mage Pro:
1. `start_time`
1. `end_time`
1. `duration` (in seconds)
1. `env` (this gets the value stored in the `ENV` environment variable)

This makes your Discord notifications more dynamic and context-aware — ideal for multi-environment deployments and advanced workflows.

## What next?

Whenever a pipeline run is successfully completed or fails, a Discord Channel message will
appear in the channel you configured the webhook URL for.

Here is an example of what that message could look like:

|                                                                                                        |
