## Configure Git settings

<Warning>
**SSH keys with passphrase are not supported**

The Git integration currently does not support repositories that require an SSH key with a passphrase.

You can, however, use the Mage terminal and the git CLI to perform your git actions.
You'll still need to generate your SSH keys as normal. You can start a ssh-agent in the terminal so that
you don't have to enter your SSH key passphrase every time you perform an action.

`eval $(ssh-agent -s) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

</Warning>

<Note>
By using the Git integration through Mage, Mage will automatically set your local repo
as a safe directory (i.e. `git config --global --add safe.directory <local repo path>`)

</Note>

To use the Mage Git integration, you will need to first configure Git settings.
The following instructions are tailored to Github, but the Git integration can work with
other Git providers as well, such as Gitlab: 

1. Ensure that `.preferences.yaml` is added to your repo's `.gitignore` file so that your Git settings aren't pushed
to Github, unless you want them to.
2. Go to your Mage settings:
![Mage settings](/media/mage-settings.png)
3. Navigate to the "Git settings" section of the Mage settings page.
4. Set up your SSH key so that your machine can access Github, if you
haven't already. Check out this sections 3 and 4 of this
[guide](https://docs.mage.ai/developing-in-the-cloud/setting-up-git#3-set-up-ssh-key)
to set up your SSH key.
5. Fill out the form:
    1. `Remote repo url`: Your Github repository's remote url. Use the SSH link instead of HTTPS link.
        ![Github url](/media/github-url.png)
    2. `Local directory path`: The directory in your machine that will be synced with the Github repository.
        If this field is omitted, it will default to the path determined by Python's `os.getcwd()`. You can
        check what your current working directory is in a Scratchpad block.
6. Fill out the remaining _optional, but recommended_ fields. Filling out these fields will allow Mage to
   recreate your git and SSH settings if they are deleted (i.e. if your container restarts):
    1. `Username`: Your git username. If you push to your remote repo, this username will show up next to your
        commits.
    2. `Email`: Your git email. Used for the same purpose as your username.
    3. `SSH public key in base64`, `SSH public key in base64`: Enter your SSH public and private key encoded in base64.
        You can follow the instructions in the field description if you want to Mage to save your SSH keys.
7. Fill out the _optional_ sync fields if you are using a [Git sync](/production/data-sync/git#git-sync)
   (this is a separate Git feature):
    1. `Branch name`: This field is only used when running a Git sync. Git syncs can be run either from this
        Git settings page, or before every trigger run.
    2. `Sync before each trigger run`: If this field is checked, then Mage will sync with Github before
        each trigger is run.
8. Save your Git settings

### Git sync

Git sync is a separate feature from integrating Mage with Github. Running a Git sync will ***overwrite all local changes***,
and replace them with the code in the specified remote branch. Git syncs can be run either from the
Git settings page, or before every trigger run if you selected the `Sync before each trigger run` field.

This feature should only be used if you are not planning to make any local changes to your Mage repository.
