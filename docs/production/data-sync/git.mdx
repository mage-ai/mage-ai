## Configure Git in Mage

<Note>
By using the Git integration through Mage, Mage will automatically set your local repo
as a safe directory (i.e. `git config --global --add safe.directory <local repo path>`)

</Note>

<Warning>
**SSH keys with passphrase are not supported**

The Git integration currently does not support repositories that require an SSH key with a passphrase.

You can, however, use the Mage terminal and the git CLI to perform your git actions.
You'll still need to generate your SSH keys as normal. You can start a ssh-agent in the terminal so that
you don't have to enter your SSH key passphrase every time you perform an action.

`eval $(ssh-agent -s) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

</Warning>

To use the Mage Git integration, you will need to first configure Git settings.
The following instructions are tailored to Github, but the Git integration can work with
other Git providers as well, such as Gitlab: 
<Steps>
<Step title="Check preferences.yaml">
 Ensure that `.preferences.yaml` is added to your repo's `.gitignore` file so that your Git settings aren't pushed to Github, unless you want them to.

  Filling out these fields will allow Mage to recreate your git and SSH settings if they are deleted (i.e. if your container restarts):

    - `Email`: Your git email. Used for the same purpose as your username.
    - `SSH public key in base64`, `SSH public key in base64`: Enter your SSH public and private key encoded in base64. You can follow the instructions in the field description if you want to Mage to save your SSH keys.

## (Optional) One-way sync

`Git sync` is a separate Git feature that allows you to tie your local project to a remote repo. Git sync is particularly useful for deploymentâ€” for example if you'd like a hosted Mage instance to stay up-to-date with a repo.

<Warning>
    Enabling Git sync limits Git to a _unidirectional_ sync. This means that changes made to your local repo will be
    *overwritten* by the remote repo. To sync both ways, leave Git sync disabled.
</Warning>

Running a Git sync will ***overwrite all local changes***
and replace them with the code in the specified remote branch. Git syncs can be run either from the
Git settings page, or before every trigger run if you selected the `Sync before each trigger run` field.

To enable Git Sync, navigate to the settings page _after_ you've configured your Git settings and tick the `Git Sync` box.

## Git settings as environment variables

You can choose to pass in Git settings as environment variables. Mage will read from these environment
variables to configure your Git repo.
