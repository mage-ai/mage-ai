title: "Git sync"
description: "One way sync with a specified git repository."
---

`Git sync` is a Git feature that allows you to tie your local project to a remote repo. When Git sync is enabled, you will only be able to pull in changes from the remote repository.
Git sync is particularly useful for deployment— for example if you'd like a hosted Mage instance to stay up-to-date with a repo.

<Warning>
    Enabling Git sync limits Git to a _unidirectional_ sync. This means that changes made to your local repo will be
    *overwritten* by the remote repo. To sync both ways, use a different Git integration.
</Warning>

Running a Git sync will ***overwrite all local changes***
and replace them with the code in the specified remote branch. Git syncs can be run either from the
Git settings page, or before every trigger run if you selected the `Sync before each trigger run` field.

To enable Git Sync, navigate to the settings page _after_ you've configured your Git settings and tick the `Git Sync` box.

        - `Authentication type`: Select which kind of authentication to use for the Git Sync
        - `Remote repo url`: Your Github repository's remote url. Use the SSH link or HTTPS link depending on the authentication type.
        - `Local directory path`: The directory in your machine that will be synced with the Github repository. If this field is omitted, it will default to the path determined by Python's `os.getcwd()`. You can check what your current working directory is in a Scratchpad block.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Fill out the sync fields">
        - `Include submodules`: Include git submodules in the sync. See the `Syncing git submodules` section for more information.
        - `Branch name`: Specify branch to sync with.
        - `Sync before each trigger run`: If this field is checked, then Mage will sync with Github before each trigger is run.
        - `Sync on server start up`: If this field is checked, then Mage will sync with the Git repo when Mage is started.

        <Warning>
        **SSH keys with passphrase are not supported**

        The Git integration currently does not support repositories that require an SSH key with a passphrase.

        You can, however, use the Mage terminal and the git CLI to perform your git actions.
        You'll still need to generate your SSH keys as normal. You can start a ssh-agent in the terminal so that
        you don't have to enter your SSH key passphrase every time you perform an action.

        `eval $(ssh-agent -s) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

        This will allow your machine to access GitHub. 
        Check out this sections this [guide](/production/data-sync/git-integration#configure-git-in-mage) to set up your SSH key.

        Filling out these fields will allow Mage to recreate your git and SSH settings if they are deleted (i.e. if your container restarts):
            - `Username`: Your git username. If you push to your remote repo, this username will show up next to your commits.
            - `Email`: Your git email. Used for the same purpose as your username.
            - `SSH public key in base64`, `SSH public key in base64`: Enter your SSH public and private key encoded in base64. You can follow the instructions in the field description if you want to Mage to save your SSH keys.

### Syncing git submodules

<Warning>
    Repositories synced through Mage will only update 1 level of submodules. If your submodule
    contains other submodules, you will need to manually update them or reformat your submodules.
</Warning>

If your repo contains git submodules, you can enable syncing for them by ticking the `Include submodules` box. Mage will
use the same credentials that are provided for the main repository to update the submodules.

## Git sync settings as environment variables

You can choose to pass in Git settings as environment variables. Mage will read from these environment
variables to configure your Git repo.
