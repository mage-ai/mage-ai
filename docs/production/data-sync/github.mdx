### Authenticate with GitHub

Click the button labeled <b>Authenticate with GitHub</b> to authenticate with GitHub.

After authorizing Mage, you’ll be redirected back to the initial page and an access token will
be in the URL as a parameter. This access token is saved in your application’s database;
it never leaves your application’s database.

### Add remote

Enter a name for your new remote. For the remote URL, you must use the `https` version of the
GitHub repository (as opposed to the `SSH` version).

For example, the remote URL for Mage is `https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai.git`.

Note that a remote added via HTTPS/SSH authentication _will not_ work— only a remote in the format above is accepted.

Once you fill in both input text fields, click the button labeled <b>Create new remote</b>.
