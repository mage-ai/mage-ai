## Sync data with Github

_WARNING_: By setting up your repository to sync data with Github, the local
directory that you choose will be overwritten with the data from Github
when a sync occurs.

If you have your pipeline data stored in a remote repository in Github,
you can sync your local project with the remote repository through Mage.
You can do so by performing the following steps:

1. Go to your Mage settings:
![Mage settings](/media/mage-settings.png)
2. Navigate to the "Sync data" section of the Mage settings page.
3. Set up your SSH key so that your machine can access Github, if you
haven't already. Check out this [guide](https://docs.mage.ai/developing-in-the-cloud/setting-up-git)
on how to set up your SSH key.
4. Fill out the form:
    1. `Remote repo url`: Your Github repository's remote url.
    ![Github url](/media/github-url.png)
    2. `Branch name`: The remote branch you want sync your data with.
    3. `Local directory path`: The directory in your machine that will be synced with the Github repository.
        If this field is omitted, it will default to the path determined by Python's `os.getcwd()`. You can
        check what your current working directory is in a Scratchpad block.
    4. `Sync before each trigger run`: If this field is checked, then Mage will sync with Github before
        each trigger is run. 
5. Save your sync settings
6. Ensure that `.preferences.yaml` is added to your `.gitignore` file so that your settings
won't get overwritten during the sync.
7. If you want to run a 1 time sync, you can click the `Run Sync` button. Otherwise, your Github
sync should be set up!
