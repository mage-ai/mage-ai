## Configure Git in Mage

<Note>
By using the Git integration through Mage, Mage will automatically set your local repo
as a safe directory (i.e. `git config --global --add safe.directory <local repo path>`)

</Note>

To use the Mage Git integration, you will need to first configure Git settings.
The following instructions are tailored to Github, but the Git integration can work with
other Git providers as well, such as GitLab, BitBucket, or Azure DevOps:

<Warning>
**SSH keys with passphrase are not supported**

The Git integration currently does not support repositories that require an SSH key with a passphrase.

You can, however, use the Mage terminal and the git CLI to perform your git actions.
You'll still need to generate your SSH keys as normal. You can start a ssh-agent in the terminal so that
you don't have to enter your SSH key passphrase every time you perform an action.

`eval $(ssh-agent -s) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

</Warning>

 Ensure that `.preferences.yaml` is added to your repo's `.gitignore` file so that your Git settings aren't pushed to Github, unless you want them to.

## Usage

Once your git settings are configured, you can use the Git integration to perform git actions.
To start, click the button at the top right with the name of the current branch.

<img src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/version-control/git-integration/branch-button.png?raw=true" width="100%"/>

Once the modal is open, you can start performing actions. Currently, the Git integration supports the following actions:
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Clone repository">
Clone repository will allow you to clone the specified git repository to your local machine.
_This operation will overwrite all local changes you have in the local git directory._
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Create new branch">
Create new branch will create a new branch in your local git directory. Specify the name of the branch and click `Create`. You will
automatically be switched to the new branch.

<img src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/version-control/git-integration/create-new-branch.png?raw=true" width="100%"/>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Switch branch">
To switch your local branch, you can click the dropdown menu with the current active branch and select the branch you would like to switch to.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Commit & push">
<Steps>
<Step title="Select files">

</Step>
</Steps>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Pull">
Pull your changes from the remote branch to your local branch. This operation is equivalent to `git pull mage-repo <current-branch>`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Hard reset">
Hard reset your local branch with the remote branch. This operation is equivalent to `git reset --hard mage-repo/<current-branch>`.

_This operation will overwrite your local changes._
</Accordion>
