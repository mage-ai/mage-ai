## What is Mage Pro?

**Mage Pro** is a production-grade platform for building, running, and scaling data pipelines — with zero infrastructure hassle. You can deploy it as:

- A **fully managed cloud service** (Mage-hosted)
- A **private cloud** installation (your cloud, your control)
- A **hybrid cloud** setup (Mage manages control plane; you host workloads)

Mage Pro supports all major cloud providers including **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Azure**, and is designed for teams that need high scalability, security, and reliability.

---

## Deployment Options

### ☁️ Fully Managed Cloud (Mage-hosted)

Let Mage handle everything: we manage infrastructure, upgrades, availability, and monitoring.

### 🔒 Private Cloud (Your Infrastructure)

Run Mage Pro securely in your own cloud environment. Ideal for teams with data residency or compliance requirements.

### 🔁 Hybrid Cloud (Split Control)

Keep data and compute in your environment while Mage manages the control plane. The best of both worlds — reduced overhead, full data privacy.
