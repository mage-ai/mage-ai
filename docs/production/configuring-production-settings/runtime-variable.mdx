Runtime Variables are a set of global variables that can be used by every block.
These are useful for storing constants shared by multiple blocks or constants
whose value is determined at pipeline runtime (hence _runtime_ variables).

## Using Runtime Variables

Runtime Variables can be accessed via the `**kwargs` parameter in your block
function.

```python
from pandas import DataFrame
from os import path

if 'data_loader' not in globals():
    from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import data_loader


@data_loader
def loader_data(**kwargs) -> DataFrame:
    filepath = kwargs.get('filepath')
    row_limit = kwargs.get('row_limit')
    return pd.read_csv(filepath, nrows=row_limit)
```

Currently, runtime variables must be of primitive Python types or some basic
containers:

- integer
- string
- float
- boolean
- list
- dictionary
- set

Runtime variable names must be a valid Python identifier (i.e., no spaces in
name, can't start with a number).

## Creating Runtime Variables In-Editor

You can create new global variables from the Mage UI through the "Variables" tab
in the sidekick. Click the "New" button, and configure your variable's name and
value, and press Enter to save.

## Default Runtime Variables

Mage provides some default variables to give context on the pipeline execution.

- `execution_date`: A datetime object that the pipeline is executed at.
- `event`: If the pipeline is triggered by event, the `event` variable contains
  the event payload.

## Running Pipeline with Runtime Variables

### Run from command line

You can execute your pipeline with runtime variables from the command line.
First, make sure you installed the package.

```bash
pip install mage-ai
```

Once the package is installed, you can run your pipeline through the command
line.

```bash
mage run <project_path> <pipeline_uuid> --runtime-vars [name value]...

# example with 2 runtime variables "name" and "ds":
mage run default_repo default_pipeline --runtime-vars name default ds 2022-08-18
```

### Run from Python script

If your pipeline is configured to use runtime variables, you can still execute
your pipeline outside the code editor. Provide the runtime variables as keyword
arguments to `mage_ai.run()`:

```python
mage_ai.run('sample_pipeline', 'repos/default_repo', filepath = 'path/to/my/file.csv', row_limit=1000)
```

## Example - Aggregating Daily Logs

A common use of ETL pipelines is to process and analyze daily events. In the
case of this example, we will create an ETL pipeline to analyze log messages
from a web application. Suppose the following is an example of a log file that
our web application produces.

| log_date            | type    | source    |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| 2022-07-27T20:19:20 | INFO    | react-1   |
| 2022-07-27T19:18:45 | WARNING | express-2 |
| 2022-07-27T16:35:28 | DEBUG   | react-1   |
| 2022-07-27T10:19:32 | INFO    | express-1 |
| 2022-07-27T07:20:26 | ERROR   | express-1 |
| 2022-07-27T00:42:37 | ERROR   | react-1   |

Suppose we want to know the distribution of log types at the end of every day.
Using Mage's runtime variables this is made a very simple task:

1. Create a data loader to load all log files modified on a specific date. We
   will specify the log folder and the date to load logs from using **runtime
   variables** which are passed to this block via the `**kwargs` parameter.

   ```python
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta, date
   from pandas import DataFrame, concat, read_csv
   from pathlib import Path
   import os

   if 'data_loader' not in globals():
       from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import data_loader


   @data_loader
   def load_log_data(**kwargs) -> DataFrame:
       start = datetime.fromisoformat(kwargs.get('current_date'))
       end = start + timedelta(days=1)
       logpath = Path(kwargs.get('log_folder'))
       logs = []
       for file in logpath.iterdir():
           print(file)
           modification_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getmtime(file))
           if modification_time >= start and modification_time < end:
               df = read_csv(file)
               logs.append(df)
       return concat(logs, axis=0)
   ```

   _Note_: This code ignores the edge case of a log file that spills over
   between days. Since the modification date is used instead of the creation
   date, a log file that is modified between days will only be considered in the
   latter day.

2. Calculate the distribution of log types over this date

   ```python
   from pandas import DataFrame
   from os import path
   import pandas as pd

   if 'transformer' not in globals():
       from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import transformer


   @transformer
   def extract_statistics(df: DataFrame, **kwargs) -> DataFrame:
       now = kwargs.get('current_date')
       count = df['type'].value_counts()
       count = DataFrame({now: count}).T
       return count
   ```

   The result of this transformer is a new data frame that looks like below:

    |   | DEBUG | ERROR | INFO | WARNING |
    | - | ---------- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
    | 2022-07-28 | 816 | 765 | 828 | 871 |

This data can then be ingested into a log statistics database.

**Key:** As the current date and log folder are not hardcoded in the pipeline
but instead provided as a runtime variable, your pipeline code remains reusable
without having to change any code. Every day, the pipeline can be ran using
`mage_ai.run()`, providing the current date and log folder as keyword arguments:

```python
mage_ai.run('log_stats_ingestion', 'repos/default_repo', current_date='2022-07-29', log_folder='logs/webapp')
```

## Example - Model Rockets

Consider the following sample data tracking the launch angle (in degrees) and
vertical velocity (in meters per second) of model rocket tests:

| launch_id | angle | vertical_velocity |
| --------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| 1         | 28.4  | 61.34             |
| 2         | 14.4  | 32.03             |
| 3         | 61.4  | 113.19            |
| 4         | 44.2  | 89.96             |
| 5         | 39.5  | 82.00             |
| 6         | 79.3  | 126.73            |
| 7         | 74.9  | 124.51            |
| 8         | 38.1  | 79.6              |

Suppose we want to convert the launch angle from degrees to radians in our
pipeline. The example below uses the `pi` runtime variable (passed in through
`**kwargs`) to convert the degrees column of some input data frame to a radians.
This allows us to control the precision with which we want to store `pi`.

```python
from pandas import DataFrame
from os import path

if 'transformer' not in globals():
    from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import transformer


@transformer
def convert_to_radians(df: DataFrame, **kwargs) -> DataFrame:
    pi = kwargs.get('pi')
    df['angle_radians'] = df['angle'] * pi / 180
    return df
```

Suppose also want to convert the velocity from meters per second to kilometers
per hour by multiplying by the constant 3.6. Using the runtime variable
`conversion_factor` (again passed in through `**kwargs`), the vertical velocity
in kilometers per hour can be computed:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame
from os import path

if 'transformer' not in globals():
    from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import transformer


@transformer
def convert_velocity(df: DataFrame, **kwargs) -> DataFrame:
    conversion_factor = kwargs.get('conversion_factor')
    df['converted_vertical_velocity'] = df['vertical_velocity'] * conversion_factor
    return df
```

Now that your pipeline is complete, you can run your pipeline using
`mage_ai.run()`. Specify values for runtime variables as keyword arguments to
this function:

```python
mage_ai.run('model_rocket_data_ingestion', 'repos/default_repo', pi=3.1415, conversion_factor=3.6)
```

Suppose after creating your pipeline, you instead want to store your velocity in
miles per hour instead of kilometers per hour. As the conversion factor is a
runtime variable, you don't have to edit your pipeline - you just have to change
the conversion factor which your pipeline is run with!

```python
mage_ai.run('model_rocket_data_ingestion', 'repos/default_repo', pi=3.1415, conversion_factor=2.24)
```
