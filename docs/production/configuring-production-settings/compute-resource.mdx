Follow the instructions in this [document](/production/deploying-to-cloud/using-terraform) to deploy
Mage in a production environment. When running Mage in production,
you can customize the compute resource for the following services:

1. Front-end application
1. Pipeline executor
1. Block executor

## Front-end application

Customize the compute resource of the Mage web service.

The Mage web service is responsible for running Mage web backend, scheduler service
and local block executions.

You can customize the CPU and memory of the Mage web
service by updating the Terraform variables and then running `terraform apply`.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Update the `ecs_task_cpu` and `ecs_task_memory` variables in the
[`mage-ai-terraform-templates/aws/variables.tf`](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/aws/variables.tf)
file.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Update the `container_cpu` and `container_memory` variables in the
[`mage-ai-terraform-templates/gcp/variables.tf`](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/gcp/variables.tf)
file.

## Pipeline executor

Set the pipelineâ€™s executor type to customize the compute resources for pipeline runs.
Here are the available executor types:

* `local_python`
* `k8s`
* `ecs`

### Default for all blocks in a pipeline

You can set the executor type for all the blocks in a pipeline by specifying the `executor_type` at pipeline level.

---

## Block executor

Mage provides multiple executors to execute blocks.
Here are the available executor types:

* `local_python`
* `k8s`
* `ecs`
* `azure_container_instance`
* `gcp_cloud_run`

### Default for all blocks

Mage uses `local_python` executor type by default. If you want to specify another executor_type as the default executor type for blocks,
you can set the environment variable `DEFAULT_EXECUTOR_TYPE` to one executor type mentioned above.
