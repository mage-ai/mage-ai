## Settings

### Read only access

You can configure Mage to not allow any edits to pipelines or blocks. Users will only
be able to create triggers and view the existing pipelines. They will also have access to
features such as syncing with Github and future remote repository integrations.

To enable this feature set the following environment variable:
`export DISABLE_NOTEBOOK_EDIT_ACCESS=1`

### Databases

By default, Mage uses sqlite to store orchestration data (trigger, pipeline run, and block run). To use a different database, you can set the `MAGE_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL` environment variable.

In production, you can set the environment variable in the corresponding Terraform script.

#### Postgres
`export MAGE_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname`
