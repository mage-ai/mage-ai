## Set up webhooks for Teams

Follow these
[instructions on Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook)
to setup incoming webhooks for your workspace.

---

## Update Mage project settings

Once youâ€™ve set up webhooks for Teams, you should have a webhook URL that Teams
provides.

Here is an example webhook (yours may vary):

```
https://teams.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/B04XXXXGY67/IncomingWebhook/1UgUkao8pXXXXPmsuXXXX2lk
```

Follow these steps to add that webhook URL to your project settings:

1. Open the Mage tool in your browser (e.g. http://localhost:6789/).
2. Open a pipeline and start editing it (e.g.
   http://localhost:6789/pipelines/example_pipeline/edit).
3. In your left sidebar in the file browser, scroll all the way down and click
   on a file named `metadata.yaml`.
4. In the `metadata.yaml` file, add the following values:

```yaml
notification_config:
  Teams_config:
    webhook_url: 'https://teams.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/B04XXXXGY67/IncomingWebhook/1UgUkao8pXXXXPmsuXXXX2lk'
```

1. Change the `webhook_url` value to be the webhook URL you created from Teams.

---

## What next?

Whenever a pipeline run is successfully completed or fails, a Teams message will
appear in the channel you configured the webhook URL for.

Here is an example of what that message could look like:

|                                                                                                        |
