## Provide your Sentry credentials

You will need to add the following environment variables in order to use
Sentry in mage:
* SENTRY_DSN: sentry dsn url
* SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE: (optional) value between 0 and 1

## Using Sentry in Mage

Once you set the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable, the Sentry integration will be
enabled the next time you start the Mage server. All uncaught errors from the trigger runs
and the Mage scheduler will be caught and sent to Sentry. Additionally, if you
run your pipelines using the `mage run` CLI command, the errors from the run will
be sent to Sentry as well.
