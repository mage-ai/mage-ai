## Set up webhooks for Slack

Follow these
[instructions on Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005265063-Incoming-webhooks-for-Slack)
to setup incoming webhooks for your workspace.

---

## Update Mage project settings

Once youâ€™ve set up webhooks for Slack, you should have a webhook URL that Slack
provides.

Here is an example webhook (yours may vary):

```
https://hooks.slack.com/services/T01XXXXRKMJ/B04XXXXGY67/1UgUkao8pXXXXPmsuXXXX2lk
```

Follow these steps to add that webhook URL to your project settings:

1. Open the Mage tool in your browser (e.g. http://localhost:6789/).
2. Open a pipeline and start editing it (e.g.
   http://localhost:6789/pipelines/example_pipeline/edit).
3. In your left sidebar in the file browser, scroll all the way down and click
   on a file named `metadata.yaml`.
4. In the `metadata.yaml` file, add the following values:

```yaml
notification_config:
  slack_config:
    webhook_url: ...
```

1. Change the `webhook_url` value to be the webhook URL you created from Slack.

---

## What next?

Whenever a pipeline run is successfully completed or fails, a Slack message will
appear in the channel you configured the webhook URL for.

Here is an example of what that message could look like:

|                                                                                                        |
