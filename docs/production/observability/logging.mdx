## Server Logging

The server logger can be configured to adjust the amount of detail that is included in the server logs. This can be helpful for debugging or troubleshooting server issues. You can change the verbosity level of the logger by setting the `SERVER_VERBOSITY` environment variable.

The `SERVER_VERBOSITY` variable accepts the following values: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` and `CRITICAL`.

## Pipelines logging
By default, logs for each pipeline run will be stored in the
`<path_to_project>/pipelines/<pipeline_name>/.logs` folder.

Learn more about logs [here](/design/core-abstractions#log).

### Set logging level
The default logging level is `INFO`. To customize the logging level for logs of block runs and pipeline runs,
you can set the `level` of `logging_config` in your project's `metadata.yaml` file.

Example logging config to only log errors:
```yaml
logging_config:
  level: ERROR
```

## Logging to external destination

### S3

To store logs in S3, you need to set the `logging` config in your project's `metadata.yaml` file.

Example S3 logging config:
```yaml
logging_config:
  type: s3
  level: INFO
  destination_config:
    bucket: <bucket name>
    prefix: <prefix path>
```

### Google Cloud Storage

To store logs in GCS, you need to set the `logging` config in your project's `metadata.yaml` file.

Example GCS logging config:
```yaml
logging_config:
  type: gcs
  level: INFO
  destination_config:
    path_to_credentials: <path to gcp credentials json file>
    bucket: <bucket name>
    prefix: <prefix path>
```

## Edit pipeline logging

When you’re editing a pipeline (e.g. `/pipelines/[uuid]/edit`), you can execute the code for an
individual block and see the output. Any `print` statements in the block of code is displayed
in the block’s output.

However, you can redirect those `print` statements to output to logs.

To toggle this feature, go to the pipeline settings page (e.g. `/pipelines/[uuid]/settings`)
and check the box labeled
<b>When running a block while editing a pipeline, output the block messages to the logs</b>.
