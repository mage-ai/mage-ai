## Creating secrets

1. Go to
   [Google Secret Manager UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager?referrer=search&authuser=1).
2. Click the button at the top labeled **`+ CREATE SECRET`**.
3. Fill in the name of your secret; e.g. `bigquery_credentials`.
4. Under **Secret value**, upload your service account credentials JSON file or
   paste the JSON into the text area labeled **Secret value**.
5. Scroll all the way down and click the button **`CREATE SECRET`**.

You can mount secrets from Google Secret Manager through Terraform configurations or through the Google Console UI.

## Using secrets locally

### Download credentials from GCP UI

1. Download the credentials JSON file from GCP.
1. Run Mage and mount the secrets as a volume in Docker.
Follow these [instructions](/getting-started/setup#using-secret-credential-files-in-docker) to learn how to do this.
1. Here are example code snippets to read from that credentials JSON file:

        <CodeGroup>
        ```python Python
        with open('/home/secrets/gcp_credentials.json', 'r') as f:
            print(f.read())
        ```

        ```yaml YAML
        demo:
        target: prod
        outputs:
          prod_bigquery:
            dataset: mage_demo
            keyfile: /home/secrets/gcp_credentials.json
            method: service-account
            project: my_cool_gcp_project
            threads: 1
            type: bigquery
        ```

        </CodeGroup>

        > Note
        >
        > This code example assumes your credentials JSON file downloaded from GCP is named
        > `gcp_credentials.json` and that the mount path (e.g. `-v`) you used when running Docker
        > is `/home/secrets`.

### Download credentials using `gcloud` CLI

1. Authenticate locally by running this command in your local terminal:

    ```
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

1. Create a new `.env` file in your Mage project folder with the following values:

    ```
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[PATH TO YOUR USER CREDENTIALS, MOST LIKELY: ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json]"
    GCS_BUCKET=[YOUR DEV BUCKET]
    GCLOUD_PROJECT=[YOUR PROJECT]
    ```

1. Run Mage using Docker and set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
Follow these [instructions](/getting-started/setup#environment-variables) to learn how to do this.
    For example, set the environment variable to:

    ```
    -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/tmp/keys/FILE_NAME.json
    ```

1. Run Mage and mount the secrets as a volume in Docker.
Follow these [instructions](/getting-started/setup#using-secret-credential-files-in-docker) to learn how to do this.
    For example:

    ```
    -v ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json:/tmp/keys/FILE_NAME.json
    ```

1. Here is an example code snippet:

    ```python
    from google.cloud import storage
    from pandas import DataFrame
    from datetime import datetime
    import pytz
    import os
    ​
    ​
    @data_exporter
    def export_data_to_google_cloud_storage(df: DataFrame, **kwargs) -> None:
    ​
        bucket_name = os.getenv('GCS_BUCKET')
    ​
        now = datetime.utcnow()
        pt = pytz.timezone("America/Los_Angeles")
        now_pst = pytz.utc.localize(now).astimezone(pt)
    ​
        object_key = f'test_file_{now_pst.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}.csv'
    ​
        storage_client = storage.Client()
        bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
        blob = bucket.blob(object_key)
    ​
        blob.upload_from_string(df.to_csv())
    ​
        print(f'df uploaded to {bucket}/{object_key}.')
    ```

## GCP Secret Manager Integration in Mage Pro

import { ProButton } from '/snippets/pro/button.mdx';
import { ProOnly } from '/snippets/pro/only.mdx';

<ProOnly source="gcp-secret" />

Securely manage and inject sensitive credentials into your Mage Pro pipelines using **Google Cloud Secret Manager**. This Pro-only feature helps enterprises meet cloud security and compliance standards by keeping secrets like API keys, database passwords, and tokens outside of source code.

### Required Environment Variables

Before accessing secrets, configure your Mage Pro cluster with the following environment variables:

- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`:
  Full path to your **GCP service account credentials JSON file**.
  _You can upload the credentials file directly to the Mage Pro cluster using the file browser interface._

- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`:
  The **Google Cloud Project ID** associated with your Secret Manager secrets.

These credentials must have `Secret Manager Secret Accessor` permissions for the secrets you intend to retrieve.


### How to Use the GCP Secret Variable

You can reference GCP secrets programmatically in Python blocks or declaratively in YAML configs.

#### Python code

Use this approach inside a block in your Mage pipeline:

```python
from mage_ai.services.gcp.secret_manager.secret_manager import get_secret

# Retrieve a secret by ID from GCP Secret Manager
secret_value = get_secret('secret_id')
```

#### YAML config
To inject a secret dynamically into a YAML config (e.g., for a data source, destination, or authentication setting):
```yaml
{{gcp_secret_var('secret_id')}}
```
Mage will automatically resolve and substitute the secret value at runtime.
