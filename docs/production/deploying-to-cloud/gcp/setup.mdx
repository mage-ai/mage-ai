## Pre-requisites

### Setup

[Download Mage maintained Terraform scripts](/production/deploying-to-cloud/using-terraform).

### Permissions

Go to the IAM management dashboard, find the service account associated to the
account you just logged into, and then add these roles to that service account
(e.g. choose your account as the principal when adding new roles):

1. Artifact Registry Read
2. Artifact Registry Writer
3. Cloud Run Developer
4. Cloud SQL
5. Service Account Token Creator

---

## Terraform plan

You can run the following command to see all the resources that will be created
by Terraform:

```bash
cd gcp
```

```bash
terraform plan
```

By default, here are the **[resources](/production/deploying-to-cloud/gcp/resources)** that will be
created.

---

## 1. Install `gcloud` CLI

Follow these [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) to
install the CLI on your workstation.

For macOS and Homebrew, you can do the following:

```bash
brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
```

---

## 2. Log into GCP from CLI

If you don’t already have an account in GCP, create one
[here](https://cloud.google.com/).

Once you created an account, from your terminal run the following command to log
in:

```bash
gcloud init
```

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

## 3. Push Docker image to GCP Artifact Registry

GCP doesn’t support using Docker images from Docker Hub. We’ll need to pull the
Mage Docker image, tag it, and push it to
[GCP Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry).

Here are the steps we’ll take:

1.  Create a repository on
    [GCP Artifact Registry](https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts) by
    clicking the **`+ CREATE REPOSITORY`** button.

    - Fill in the **Name**
    - Choose Docker as the **Format**
    - Choose any **Location type**
    - Choose any **Encryption**
    - Click **`CREATE`**

2.  Click on the newly created repository (e.g. `mage-docker`).
3. Near the top of the page, click the link **`SETUP INSTRUCTIONS`** or read these
    [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/authentication)
    to set up authentication for Docker.

    - Run the following command in your terminal:

        ```bash
        gcloud auth configure-docker [region]-docker.pkg.dev
        ```

    - An example command could look like this:

        ```bash
        gcloud auth configure-docker us-west2-docker.pkg.dev
        ```

4. Pull the Mage Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker pull mageai/mageai:latest
    ```

    - If your local workstation is using macOS and a silicon chip (e.g. M1, M2,
    etc), then run this command instead:

        ```bash
        docker pull --platform linux/amd64 mageai/mageai:latest
        ```

5.  Tag the pulled Mage docker image or use a previously tagged Docker image you
    built when following this [CI/CD guide](/production/ci-cd):

    - Sample commands if using vanilla Mage Docker image:

        ```bash
        docker tag mageai/mageai:latest [region]-docker.pkg.dev/[project_id]/[repository]/mageai:latest
        ```

        - An example command could look like this:

            ```bash
            docker tag mageai/mageai:latest us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/materia-284023/mage-docker/mageai:latest
            ```

    - Sample commands if using previously tagged a custom Docker image using the tag `mageprod:latest`:

        ```bash
        docker tag mageprod:latest [region]-docker.pkg.dev/[project_id]/[repository]/mageai:latest
        ```

        - An example command could look like this if you previously tagged your custom Docker image with the tag `mageprod:latest`:

            ```bash
            docker tag mageprod:latest us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/materia-284023/mage-docker/mageai:latest
            ```

6.  Push the local Docker image to GCP Artifact Registry:

    ```bash
    docker push [region]-docker.pkg.dev/[project_id]/[repository]/mageai:latest
    ```

    - An example command could look like this:

        ```bash
        docker push us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/materia-284023/mage-docker/mageai:latest
        ```

---

## 4. Customize Terraform settings

**Project ID (REQUIRED)**

Before running any Terraform commands, please change the `default` value of the
variable named `project_id` in the
[./gcp/variables.tf](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/gcp/variables.tf)
file.

```js
variable "project_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "The name of the project"
  default     = "unique-gcp-project-id"
}
```

**Docker image (REQUIRED)**

In the repository you created in GCP Artifact Repository, you’ll see a list of
Docker images. Click on an image name, then copy the full path to the image
(e.g. `us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/materia-284023/mage-docker/mageai`).

In the file
[./gcp/variables.tf](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/gcp/variables.tf),
you can change the `default` value under `docker_image`:

```js
variable "docker_image" {
  type        = string
  description = "The Docker image url in the Artifact Registry repository to be deployed to Cloud Run"
  default     = "us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/materia-284023/mage-docker/mageai"
}
```

**Application Name**

In the file
[./gcp/variables.tf](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/gcp/variables.tf),
you can change the `default` value under `app_name`:

```js
variable "app_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "Application Name"
  default     = "mage-data-prep"
}
```

**Region**

In the file
[./gcp/main.tf](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/gcp/main.tf),
you can change the `default` value under `region`:

```js
variable "region" {
  type        = string
  description = "The default compute region"
  default     = "us-west2"
}
```

**Application Environment Variables**

Set your environment variables in your running cloud environment by adding the
following under the resource named `google_cloud_run_service` in the file
[./gcp/main.tf](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/gcp/main.tf):

```js
resource "google_cloud_run_service" "run_service" {
  ...

  template {
    spec {
      containers {
        ...
        env {
          name  = "NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE"
          value = "value of environment variable"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Secrets

1. Go to
   [Google Secret Manager UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager?referrer=search&authuser=1).
2. Click the button at the top labeled **`+ CREATE SECRET`**.
3. Fill in the name of your secret; e.g. `bigquery_credentials`.
4. Under **Secret value**, upload your service account credentials JSON file or
   paste the JSON into the textarea labeled **Secret value**.
5. Scroll all the way down and click the button **`CREATE SECRET`**.

You can mount secrets from Google Secret Manager through Terraform
configurations or through the Google Console UI.

#### Method A: Terraform configurations

1.  Once you save a secret in Google Secret Manager, click on the
    **PERMISSIONS** tab.
2.  Click the button **`+ GRANT ACCESS`**.
3.  Under the field labeled **New principles**, add the service account that is
    associated to your Google Cloud Run. If you can’t find this, try deploying
    GCP with Terraform and you’ll receive an error that looks like this:

    ```
    ╷
    │ Error: resource is in failed state "Ready:False", message: Revision 'mage-2992l' is not ready and cannot serve traffic. spec.template.spec.volumes[1].secret.items[0].key: Permission denied on secret: projects/1054912425479/secrets/bigquery_credentials/versions/latest for Revision service account 1054912425479-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com. The service account used must be granted the 'Secret Manager Secret Accessor' role (roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor) at the secret, project or higher level.
    │
    │   with google_cloud_run_service.run_service,
    │   on main.tf line 88, in resource "google_cloud_run_service" "run_service":
    │   88: resource "google_cloud_run_service" "run_service" {
    │
    ╵
    ```

    If you still get this error when re-running `terraform apply` even after granting access,
    try **Method B** down below.

    <Note>
      By default, the service account used by Cloud Run that needs access to the secret is the `Compute Engine` default service account.
      If you want to grant access to a different service account,
      configure the `service_account_name` argument in the `spec` block in
      [`main.tf`](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/gcp/main.tf#L99):

      ```
      # Create the Cloud Run service
      resource "google_cloud_run_service" "run_service" {
        name = var.app_name
        location = var.region

        template {
          spec {
            service_account_name = "[your service account email here]"
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    </Note>

4.  Under the field labeled **Select a role**, enter the value
    `Secret Manager Secret Accessor`.
5.  Click the button **SAVE**.
6.  Mount secrets to Google Cloud Run via Terraform in the file
    [./gcp/main.tf](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/gcp/main.tf):

    ```
    resource "google_cloud_run_service" "run_service" {
      ...

      template {
        spec {
          containers {
            ...
            env {
              name = "path_to_keyfile"
              value = "/secrets/bigquery/bigquery_credentials"
            }
            volume_mounts {
              name       = "secrets-bigquery_credentials"
              mount_path = "/secrets/bigquery"
            }
          }
          volumes {
            name = "secrets-bigquery_credentials"
            secret {
              secret_name  = "bigquery_credentials"
              items {
                key  = "latest"
                path = "bigquery_credentials"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

7.  In your Python code or in any field that support variable interpolation,
    enter the following to get the value from the secret: 1

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import os


    with open(os.getenv('path_to_keyfile'), 'r') as f:
        print(f.read())
    ```

    ```yaml YAML
    demo:
    target: prod
    outputs:
      prod_bigquery:
        dataset: mage_demo
        keyfile: "{{ env_var('path_to_keyfile') }}"
        method: service-account
        project: my_cool_gcp_project
        threads: 1
        type: bigquery
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

#### Method B: through GCP UI (aka console but not to be confused with CLI)

1. Go to your Google Cloud Run dashboard, find the service running Mage, and
   click on it to view its details.
1. Follow these
   [Google provided instructions](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/secrets#mounting-secrets-service)
   to manually mount the secret to the running Mage Cloud Run service and grant
   the right permissions for that service to access those secrets.
After you mount the secrets, you can create environment variables in your Cloud Run that reference
your secrets. Follow the below example to setup the mounted secret and environment variable for that
secret:

    | <b>Secrets</b> |   |
    | --- | --- |
    | Secret name | `bigquery_credentials` |
    | Reference method | `Mounted as volume` |
    | Mount path | `/secrets/bigquery` |
    | Path 1 | `bigquery_credentials` |
    | Version 1 | `latest` |

    | <b>Environment variables</b> |   |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | `path_to_keyfile` |
    | Value | `/secrets/bigquery/bigquery_credentials` |

### More

Other variables defined in
[./gcp/variables.tf](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/gcp/variables.tf)
can also be customized to your needs.

---

## 5. Deploy

1. Change directory into scripts folder:
   ```bash
   cd gcp
   ```
1. Initialize Terraform:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

   A sample output could look like this:

   ```
   Initializing the backend...

   Initializing provider plugins...
   - Finding hashicorp/google versions matching ">= 3.3.0"...
   - Finding latest version of hashicorp/http...
   - Installing hashicorp/google v4.38.0...
   - Installed hashicorp/google v4.38.0 (signed by HashiCorp)
   - Installing hashicorp/http v3.1.0...
   - Installed hashicorp/http v3.1.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

   Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
   selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
   so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
   you run "terraform init" in the future.

   Terraform has been successfully initialized!

   You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
   any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
   should now work.

   If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
   rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
   commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
   ```

1. Deploy:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   A sample output could look like this:

   ```
   Apply complete! Resources: 7 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.

   Outputs:

   service_ip = "34.107.187.208"
   ```

   It’ll take a few minutes for GCP Cloud Run to start up and be ready to
   receive requests.

   After a few minutes, open a browser and go to `http://[IP_address`

   <Note>
     Change the `IP_address` to the IP address that was output in your terminal
     after successfully running `terraform apply`.
   </Note>

### Errors

**403 Forbidden**

If you get this error when trying to open the above IP address in your browser,
open the security group named
[`[application_name]-security-policy`](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-security/securitypolicies/list).
Click on that security group and verify your IP address is whitelisted.

If it isn’t, add a new rule with the following values:

| Mode       | Match                                                   | Action | Priority |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| Basic mode | [Enter your IP address](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) | Allow  | 100      |

If you still get 403, check to see if you’re using `http://` and NOT `https://`.

---

## Updating Mage versions

After Mage is running in your cloud, you can update the Mage Docker image
version by running the following command in your CLI tool:

```bash
gcloud run deploy [app_name] --image [docker_image]
```

> `app_name`
>
> This is the value you changed when editing the
> [./gcp/variables.tf](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/gcp/variables.tf)
> file.

---

## Misc

### Security

To enable other IP addresses access to Mage, open the security group named
[`[application_name]-security-policy`](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-security/securitypolicies/list).
Click on that security group and add a new rule with the following values:

| Mode       | Match                                                   | Action | Priority |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| Basic mode | [Enter your IP address](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) | Allow  | 100      |

To enable IP addresses access to specific endpoints, you can follow
[this example](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/gcp/load_balancer.tf#L23-L33)
to add rules to security policy. Another way is to add a new rule through UI
with the following values:

| Mode | Match | Action | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Advanced mode | `request.path.startsWith('/api/pipeline_schedules/123/pipeline_runs') && inIpRange(origin.ip, '[IP address]/32')` | Allow | 200 |

### HTTPS enabling

To enable HTTPS for Mage app deployed on GCP, you need to firstly make sure you
have a domain. Then follow the steps below to set up HTTPS:

1. In
   [./gcp/variables.tf](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/gcp/variables.tf)
   file, update the `default` value of `ssl` to be `true`, and set the `default`
   value of `domain` variable to be the domain url you want to use.
2. Run `terraform apply` to create the HTTPS load balancer.
3. Get the `service_ip` from the output of terraform command.
4. Update the DNS A and AAAA records to point the domain url to the load
   balancer's IP address:
   https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates/google-managed-certs#update-dns
5. Visit the domain url to access your Mage app.

### Terminate all resources

If you want to delete all resources created from deploying, run the following
command:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

A sample output could look like this:

```
Destroy complete! Resources: 10 destroyed.
```
