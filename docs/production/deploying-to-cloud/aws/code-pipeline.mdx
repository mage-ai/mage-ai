## Pre-requisites

### Terraform and AWS ECS

This document assumes you're using Terraform to modify and deploy your AWS instructure. If you're
not using Terraform yet, you can set it up by reading [this document](production/deploying-to-cloud/using-terraform).

This document also assumes that you have already set up your ECS cluster, services, and tasks.
* If you are not using ECS to run Mage, then this document will not apply for you.
  You can submit a feature request in our [Slack channel](https://www.mage.ai/chat) if you want Mage to
  support deploying to your infrastructure through AWS CodePipeline.
* If you have not set up your ECS yet, you can check out [this document](https://docs.mage.ai/production/deploying-to-cloud/aws/setup#deploy-to-ecs-cluster)
  to set it up with Terraform.

### AWS CodeCommit

The pipeline that is created through the Terraform scripts has a AWS CodeCommit repo as a source. You
will need to have a CodeCommit repo already set up that has your Mage repository code.

Your CodeCommit repository should have a Dockerfile in the top level of your CodeCommit.
[Here is a reference Dockerfile](https://github.com/mage-ai/docker/blob/master/Dockerfile)
that you can use for your own Dockerfile.

You will also need to add a `buildspec.yml` file to your repository.
The `buildspec.yml` file can follow the following format:

```
version: 0.2

phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR...
      - aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - echo Building the Docker image...          
      - docker build -t $IMAGE_REPO_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG .
      - docker tag $IMAGE_REPO_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com/$IMAGE_REPO_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG      
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`
      - echo Pushing the Docker image...
      - docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com/$IMAGE_REPO_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG
```

### AWS ECR

One pipeline created by the script will push a Docker build to AWS ECR, and the other pipeline will read from the same
AWS ECR repo. Make sure you have already created your AWS ECR repository.

## Setting up AWS CodePipeline pipeline with Terraform

Use Terraform scripts in [aws-code-pipeline](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/tree/master/aws-code-pipeline)
folder to provision resources for AWS CodePipeline.

---

### Terraform plan

You can run the following command to see all the resources that will be created
by Terraform:

```bash
cd aws
terraform plan
```

---

### 1. Environment variables

If you don’t have the AWS CLI installed, you’ll need to create this file:
`~/.aws/credentials`.

In that file, add the following values:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = XXX
aws_secret_access_key = XXX
```

Alternatively, you can install the AWS CLI by following 
[Amazon’s instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

---

### 2. Customize Terraform variables

In the file
[./aws/variables.tf](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai-terraform-templates/blob/master/aws-code-pipeline/variables.tf),
you will need to update the default values for the following variables:

**AWS settings**

```
variable "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" {
  type    = string
  default = "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
}

variable "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" {
  type    = string
  default = "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
}

variable "aws_region" {
  type        = string
  description = "AWS Region"
  default     = "us-west-2"
}

variable "aws_account_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "AWS Account ID"
  default     = "12345678910"
}
```

**S3 bucket name**

```
variable "s3_bucket_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "S3 bucket to store pipeline artifacts"
  default     = "s3-bucket-name"
}
```

**Code pipeline name (optional)**

```
variable "code_pipeline_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "Name for AWS CodePipeline"
  default     = "mage-codepipeline"
}
```

**ECR repo values**

```
variable "ecr_repo_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "ECR repo name"
  default     = "ecr-repo-name"
}

variable "ecr_image_tag" {
  type        = string
  description = "ECR docker image tag"
  default     = "latest"
}
```

**ECS values**

```
variable "ecs_cluster_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "ECS cluster name"
  default     = "ecs-cluster-name"
}

variable "ecs_service_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "ECS service name"
  default     = "ecs-service-name"
}

variable "ecs_container_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "ECS container name"
  default     = "ecs-container-name"
}

variable "ecs_task_role_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "ECS execution task role name"
  default     = "ecs-task-role-name"
}
```

**AWS CodeCommit values**

```
variable "codecommit_repo_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "Codecommit repo name"
  default     = "codecommit_repo_name"
}

variable "codecommit_branch" {
  type        = string
  description = "Codecommit repo branch"
  default     = "main"
}
```

### 3. IAM Permissions

The IAM permissions are defined in the `aws-code-pipeline/iam.tf` file. Make adjustments to the 
permissions as needed.

### 4. Apply Terraform

**Using CLI**

1. Change directory into scripts folder:
   ```bash
   cd aws-code-pipeline
   ```
2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
   - If you run into errors like the following:
     ```
     │ Error: Failed to install provider
     │
     │ Error while installing hashicorp/template v2.2.0: the local package for registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/template 2.2.0 doesn't match any of the checksums previously recorded in the dependency lock file (this might be because the available checksums are for packages targeting different
     │ platforms); for more information: https://www.terraform.io/language/provider-checksum-verification
     ```
     then run the following commands to resolve this:
     ```
     brew install kreuzwerker/taps/m1-terraform-provider-helper
     m1-terraform-provider-helper activate
     m1-terraform-provider-helper install hashicorp/template -v v2.2.0
     rm .terraform.lock.hcl
     terraform init --upgrade
     ```
3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

### Results

After running the Terraform script, you should see two AWS CodePipeline pipelines created, `mage-codepipeline`
and `mage-codepipeline-ecr` (unless you changed the `code_pipeline_name` variable). The `mage-codepipeline` pipeline
will be triggered every time a change is detected in the AWS CodeCommit repo. The `mage-codepipeline-ecr` pipeline
will be triggered every time a new image is pushed with into the AWS ECR repo.
