## Pre-install

## Install Terraform CLI

<CodeGroup>

```bash Using Homebrew
brew tap hashicorp/tap && brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
```

```bash Using Docker
docker pull hashicorp/terraform:latest
```

</CodeGroup>

### Windows

Follow [Microsoft’s instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/get-started-windows-bash?tabs=bash#4-install-terraform-for-windows) to install Terraform on Windows.

### Errors

If you’re installing Terraform using Homebrew on an Apple M1 laptop, you may get this error:

```
Error: Incompatible provider version

Provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/template v2.2.0 does not have a package available for your current platform, darwin_arm64.

Provider releases are separate from Terraform CLI releases, so not all providers are available for all platforms. 
Other versions of this provider may have different platforms supported.
```

Follow this [guide](https://blog.sanjayhona.com.np/terraform-error-incompatible-provider-version-m1-or-darwin-arm64-fae0159f913f) to fix the issue.

## Cloud specific Terraform instructions

- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](/production/deploying-to-cloud/aws)
- [Microsoft Azure](/production/deploying-to-cloud/azure)
- [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](/production/deploying-to-cloud/gcp)
