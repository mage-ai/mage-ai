### Pre-requisites

First, you'll need to enable user authentication within Mage. You can find out more about
this in the [Overview page](/production/authentication/overview).

### Enable OIDC sign in

By default, users will not see the "Sign in with OIDC" option in their sign in page.

<Steps>

<Step title="Add Oauth application">

You will need to add Mage as a client for your OIDC provider. The way to do this will
be different depending on your OIDC provider. The redirect URL should be `https://<your-mage-url>/oauth`.

</Step>

<Step title="Retrieve credentials">

Once you have registered Mage, you will need to retrieve the client ID, client secret,
and the OIDC discovery URL for your provider.

</Step>

<Step title="Set environment variables">

Set the following environment variables in your Mage setup.

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL` | `<oidc domain url>` |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | `<client id>` |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | `<client secret>` |

</Step>

</Steps>

You should now see a "Sign in with OIDC" button when you start Mage and attempt to sign in.

Mage will fetch the following OIDC endpoints from the discovery URL:

* authorization_endpoint
* token_endpoint
* userinfo_endpoint
