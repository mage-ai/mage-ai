### Pre-requisites

First, you'll need to enable user authentication within Mage. You can find out more about
this in the [Overview page](/production/authentication/overview).

### Enable Google sign in

<Note>

Mage will request access for the following scopes:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
```

</Note>

By default, users will not see the "Sign in with Google" option in their sign in page.

<Steps>

<Step title="Add Oauth application">

You will need to add Mage as an OAuth client in your Google Cloud Platform project.
For more instructions on how to do this, please see the [Google Cloud Platform documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect#appsetup).

</Step>

<Step title="Retrieve credentials">

Once you have created the credentials, you will need to get the application's client ID and client secret.
You will also need to add `http(s)://<your-mage-url>/oauth` as an authorized redirect URI.

</Step>

<Step title="Set environment variables">

Set the following environment variables in your Mage setup.

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | `<client id>` |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | `<client secret>` |

</Step>

</Steps>

You should now see the "Sign in with Google" button when you start Mage and attempt to sign in.
