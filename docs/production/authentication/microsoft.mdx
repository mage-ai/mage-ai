### Pre-requisites

First, you'll need to enable user authentication within Mage. You can find out more about
this in the [Overview page](/production/authentication/overview).

### Enable Microsoft sign in

By default, users will not see the "Sign in with Microsft" option in their sign in page. To
enable this, you will need to get your organization's Tenant ID. You can find this in the
Azure Portal:

1. Log into your Azure Portal
2. Click into the Azure Active Directory service

    <img

        src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/production/authentication/ad.png?raw=true"
    />

3. Navigate to the directory you want users to sign into
4. Click "Properties" in the left sidebar

    <img
        alt="Active Directory Properties"
        src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/production/authentication/ad-properties.png?raw=true"
    />

5. Copy the value under "Tenant ID"

    <img
        alt="Active Directory Tenant ID"
        src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/production/authentication/ad-tenant-id.png?raw=true"
    />

Once you have found your tenant ID, you will need to set the following environment variable
in your Mage setup.

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_DIRECTORY_ID` |
| Value | `<tenant_id>` |

You should now see the "Sign in with Microsoft" button when you start Mage and attempt to sign in.
