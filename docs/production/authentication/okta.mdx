### Pre-requisites

First, you'll need to enable user authentication within Mage. You can find out more about
this in the [Overview page](/production/authentication/overview).

### Enable Okta sign in

By default, users will not see the "Sign in with Okta" option in their sign in page.

<Steps>

<Step title="Add Oauth application">

You will need to add Mage as an OAuth client in your Okta organization admin dashboard.
For more instructions on how to do this, please see the [Okta developer documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/main/#create-an-oauth-2-0-app-in-okta).
Make sure you select the "Authorization Code" grant flow, and add `http(s)://<your-mage-url>/oauth` as a Sign-in redirect URI.

</Step>

<Step title="Retrieve credentials">

Once you have created the credentials, you will need to get the application's client ID and client secret.
Make sure you also have your Okta domain URL.

</Step>

<Step title="Set environment variables">

Set the following environment variables in your Mage setup.

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `OKTA_DOMAIN_URL` | `<okta domain url>` |
| `OKTA_CLIENT_ID` | `<client id>` |
| `OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET` | `<client secret>` |

</Step>

</Steps>

You should now see the "Sign in with Okta" button when you start Mage and attempt to sign in.
