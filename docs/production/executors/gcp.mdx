If your Mage app is deployed on GCP Cloud Run, you can choose to launch separate GCP Cloud Run jobs to execute blocks.

How to configure pipeline to use GCP cloud run executor:
1. Update Project's metadata.yaml
```yaml
gcp_cloud_run_config:
  path_to_credentials_json_file: "/path/to/credentials_json_file"
  project_id: project_id
  timeout_seconds: 600
```

2. Update the `executor_type` of block to `gcp_cloud_run` in pipeline's metadata.yaml:

```yaml
blocks:
- uuid: example_data_loader
  type: data_loader
  upstream_blocks: []
  downstream_blocks: []
  executor_type: gcp_cloud_run
  ...
```
Customizing compute resource for GCP Cloud Run executor is coming soon.
