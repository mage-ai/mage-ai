## Overview

A data product is any piece of data created by 1 or more blocks in a pipeline.
For example, a block can create a data product that is an in-memory DataFrame,
or a JSON serializable data structure, or a table in a database.

A global data product is a data product that can be referenced and used in any pipeline across the
entire project.
A global data product is entered into the global registry (`global_data_products.yaml`)
under a unique ID (UUID) and it references an existing pipeline.

This feature is important because multiple pipelines can depend on a single global data product,
without having to regenerate the global data product.

In addition, the global data product doesn’t have to run unless something needs its data and
its data is outdated. Its data is outdated if it hasn’t ran for a preset amount of time.
This preset time is configurable.

<b>Example</b>

If you have a computationally expensive data pipeline called `users_ltv`
that generates the lifetime value (LTV) of each user, and if you have 2 downstream pipelines
that require the data from the `users_ltv` pipeline, then using a global data product
will make sure that the `users_ltv` pipeline is ran only once as long as the `users_ltv`
data product isn’t outdated.

### Minimize number of runs

A global data product is configured to be outdated after a certain amount of time has passed
since its most recent successful run.

It can also be configured to be outdated starting at a specific time of the
year, month, week, day, hour, minute, etc.

A global data product won’t regenerate unless its been outdated.

### Lazy triggering

A global data product won’t run unless something requires its data. For example, if a block in
another pipeline depends on a global data product, then the global data product will be triggered
to run when that block is complete.

If multiple blocks in the same or different pipelines depend on a global data product and they
all attempt to trigger the global data product, it will only run once no matter how many other
blocks depend on it.

### Global referencing

A global data product can be added as a block in any pipeline.
Once added, any other blocks in that pipeline can depend on it or it can depend on other blocks.

## Register global data product

<Note>
    You must have at least 1 pipeline already created.
</Note>

1. Go to the global data products list page (e.g. http://localhost:6789/global-data-products)
    and click the button labeled <b>+ New global data product</b>.

    You must enter a unique ID (UUID) that is unique across your entire project.
1. Choose the object type `Pipeline`.
    The object types that are currently supported are:

        - `Pipeline`

    **`Block` object type coming soon.**
1. From the Object UUID dropdown, select the pipeline you want to register as a global data product.
1. Click the button labeled <b>Create global data product</b>.

## Configure settings

Once you’ve created a global data product, you can configure several different settings.

### Outdated after

After the global data product successfully completes running,
how long after that will the global data product be outdated?

You can set how many seconds, weeks, months, or years will have to pass
after the most recent successful run for the global data product to be considered outdated.

### Outdated starting at

If enough time has passed since the last global data product has ran successfully and
the global data product is determined to be outdated,
then you can configure it to be outdated at a specific date or time.

For example, let’s say the global data product is outdated after 12 hours.
The last successful run was yesterday at 18:00.
The global data product will be outdated today at 06:00.
However, if the Outdated starting at has a value of 17 for Hour of day,
then the global data product won’t run again until today at 17:00.

### Block data to output

The data output from the block(s) you select below will be the data product that is returned
when a downstream entity is requesting data from this global data product.

When requesting data from this global data product,
the selected block(s) will return data from its most recent partition.
You can override this by adding a value in the partitions setting.
For example, if you set the partitions value to 5,
then the selected block will return data from its 5 most recent partitions.
If you set the partitions value to 0, then all the partitions will be returned.

## Add to a pipeline

In a pipeline, you can add a block and choose `Global data product`.
After selecting an existing global data product, it’ll be added to the current pipeline as
a block.

### Override global settings

The default settings for the global data product will be used when it’s triggered from
another pipeline. However, you can override those default settings by configuring the
global data product block settings.

Select the global data product block you added to your pipeline.
Then, in the top right corner of the block, click the settings icon to open the block settings
in the right sidekick. From there, you can override the
<b>Outdated after</b>, <b>Outdated starting at</b>, and <b>Block data to output</b> settings.
