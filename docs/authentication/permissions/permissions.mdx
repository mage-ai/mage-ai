## Overview

- A permission grants or denies read and write operations and access on a specific entity.
- An entity maps to an existing API endpoint in the Mage application.
- A permission can grant or deny access to a specific entity with a specific UUID.
- Each operation and attribute operation has an access level that denies access
    to a specific entity for that particular operation or attribute operation.

    - When denying an attribute operation,
        define the set of attributes that the permission forbids the user from
        querying, reading, or writing.

### Query attributes

When granting `Query` access, you must define the set of query parameters this permission allows.

### Read attributes

When granting `Read` access, you must define the set of attributes this permission
allows the user to read.

### Write attributes

When granting `Write` access, you must define the set of attributes this permission
allows the user to write.

## Groups

The following access levels contain logic that grants access to multiple operations
and attribute operations.

<Note>
    The attribute operation that the group access grants still requires you
    to define the specific set of attributes that the user is permitted to
    query, read, or write.
