In a previous universe, a single Mage application supported only 1 Mage project and only read
files from sub-directories of the top-level Mage project.

In the new multi-verse, you can manage and run multiple different Mage projects and other
non-Mage projects (e.g. dbt projects).

## Structure

You’ll still need a top-level directory to store all your files and folders.
This top-level directory can be named anything. You’ll still start the Mage application
pointing to this directory. For example: `mage start multiverse_project`.

Within this top-level directory, you can add any number of files and folders in any structure
you see fit.

There are a few requirements:

1. At the root of the top-level directory, create a file named `settings.yaml`.
1. For any Mage related projects, there needs to be a file named `metadata.yaml` in the root directory
    of the Mage project you wish to use in this multi-project setup. For example, here is how
    a setup with 3 Mage projects can look:

    ```
    mutliverse_project/
        fire/
            data_loaders/
            pipelines/
            metadata.yaml
            io_config.yaml
        lightning/
            data_loaders/
            pipelines/
            metadata.yaml
            io_config.yaml
        water/
            ice/
                glacier/
                    data_loaders/
                    pipelines/
                    metadata.yaml
                    io_config.yaml
        settings.yaml
    ```

In the `settings.yaml` file, you’ll need to register the project so that Mage knows where
your active projects live.

Open the `settings.yaml` file and add the following (adjust to your specific setup):

```yaml
# multiverse_project/settings.ymal

projects:
  fire: {}
  lightning: {}
  glacier:
    path: water/ice/glacier
```

Note that the project named `glacier` has a custom path configured in the settings.
This allows Mage to reference the project using `glacier` while supporting the flexibility of
any project to be located anywhere.

## Project preferences

Each Mage project can have its own set of feature settings, custom designs, and more.

However, the top-level project can override these settings for each project.

To set project-wide settings, go to the project preferences page and on the left side there will
be a navigation option to configure the settings for the entire platform.

## Migrating an existing Mage project

If you have an existing project, take the entire project directory and add it as a sub-directory
into the new top-level folder (e.g. `multiverse_project`).

Then, add your existing project’s name to the `settings.yaml` file.
