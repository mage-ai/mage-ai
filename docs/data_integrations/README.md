## Overview

<b>Syncing external data → internal systems</b>

If you have data in 3rd party systems (e.g other SaaS tools) and you want that data available in
your database, data warehouse, or data lake, you can use Mage to sync data between those systems.

<b>Syncing internal data → external systems (reverse)</b>

Your internal database or data warehouse may contain application data generated by your
users or customers. This data can be valuable if used in conjunction with 3rd party SaaS tools.

You can use Mage to sync data from your internal systems, and have that data appear in various
3rd party SaaS tools.

## Sources

A source is a system that you want to load data from and synchronize it into another system.
A source can be a 3rd party API, SaaS, database, data warehouse, or a data lake.

Mage adheres to the data engineering standard for data integrations called the
[Singer Spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/SPEC.md).

All sources (aka taps) that has been developed by the
open-source community can be adapted to use in Mage. Here is a [short list of available ones](https://www.singer.io/#taps).
