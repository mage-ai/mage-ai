sidebarTitle: "Estuary to Mage Pro"

Estuary is great for real-time data capture—but teams often hit limits around transformation, orchestration, and control. **Mage Pro** offers an end-to-end solution for batch and streaming pipelines with **Python & SQL transformations**, full **orchestration**, and **AI-powered pipeline generation**.

## Why migrate from Estuary to Mage Pro?

Estuary specializes in real-time syncs with pre-built connectors. But it lacks flexibility for:

- Transforming data beyond the destination database
- Managing complex orchestration and dependencies
- Debugging and testing pipelines visually
- Git-native workflows and team collaboration
- Full control over schema evolution and failure handling

Mage Pro fills these gaps with **streaming + batch pipelines**, modular blocks for ETL, and full visibility into each step of your data flow.

## ✨ Mage Pro vs Estuary: Benefits Overview

| Capability | Estuary | Mage Pro |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Streaming support** | ✅ Native | ✅ Native (Kafka, CDC, webhooks) |
| **Batch processing** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full batch support |
| **Transformations** | ⚠️ Destination-only | ✅ Python, SQL, AI-generated |
| **Orchestration** | ❌ None | ✅ Full DAG-level orchestration |
| **Visual pipeline UI** | ⚠️ Schema-level only | ✅ Drag-and-drop builder |
| **AI assistance** | ❌ | ✅ Sidekick for code & pipeline generation |
| **Custom sources/targets** | ⚠️ Plugin SDK only | ✅ Python-based SDK for APIs, files, DBs |
| **Incremental loads** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Native with customizable logic |
| **Git integration** | ❌ | ✅ Git-backed projects & CI/CD |
| **Environments** | ⚠️ Single workspace | ✅ Dev, staging, and production |
| **Observability** | ⚠️ Basic logs | ✅ Detailed logs, retries, lineage |
| **Hosting** | ✅ Cloud only | ✅ Cloud or self-hosted |
| **Cost** | ⚠️ Event-volume pricing | ✅ Transparent usage-based plans |

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Migration Instructions

<Steps>

1. **Audit your Estuary flows**  
   - Export list of **flows** and their source → destination pairs  
   - Note any field mappings or transformations  
   - Identify real-time vs batch sync requirements

2. **Set up a Mage Pro workspace**  
   - Sign up at [Mage Pro](https://cloud.mage.ai)  
   - Connect a Git repo if needed for versioning and CI/CD

3. **Recreate flows as Mage pipelines**  
   - Estuary source → **Source block** in Mage Streaming Pipeline
   - Estuary destination → **Destination block** in Mage Streaming Pipeline
   - Custom transforms → **SQL** or **Python blocks**  
   - Choose between **streaming** (CDC, Kafka, webhook) or **batch**

4. **Configure scheduling or triggers**  
   - Use streaming triggers (Kafka, webhooks) or batch schedulers (cron)  
   - Add event-based triggers for more control

5. **Validate pipeline output**  
   - Run pipelines in staging  
   - Preview outputs, compare with Estuary’s destination tables  
   - Verify schema integrity, incremental updates, and deduplication

6. **Go live and monitor**  
   - Enable alerts, retry logic, and audit logging  
   - Use observability tools to track pipeline health and performance  
   - Scale pipeline workers automatically via Kubernetes or ECS

## 🤖 Use AI Sidekick to Migrate Faster

Estuary flows are often schema-mapped and repetitive—perfect for AI Sidekick to help convert into Mage pipelines.

### 🔧 How to Use It

1. Open a Mage Pro pipeline and click **"Ask AI"**  
2. Paste in an Estuary flow JSON or describe your flow  
3. Ask: **"Convert this Estuary flow into a Mage pipeline."**  
4. The AI will:
   - Create Extract/Load blocks  
   - Generate SQL or Python for transforms  
   - Add scheduling and triggers  
5. Insert and run the pipeline directly in your workspace

## 🧠 Tips for Migrating Streaming Workflows

- Use **Kafka Extract blocks** or **webhook listeners** for streaming sources  
- Combine **streaming + batch** in hybrid pipelines  
- Use **block-level caching** to test transforms on historical data  
- Handle schema evolution with **data validation and pipeline tests**

---

## ✅ After Migration: What You Gain

- One platform for **streaming + batch pipelines**  
- Visual editor with modular, testable blocks  
- AI-powered pipeline creation and debugging  
- Git-native development & multi-environment deployments  
- Better cost control and full observability  
- Built-in orchestration and transformation logic

> Estuary handles streams. Mage Pro handles **everything**—with visibility, scalability, and flexibility built-in.
