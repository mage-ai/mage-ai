Many teams start with Prefect for workflow orchestration—but soon encounter challenges with data engineering workflows, visual debugging, and developer productivity. Mage Pro offers a modern alternative: visual pipelines, built-in data integration, AI-assisted development, and UI-based deployment management—all within a unified platform for your data workflows.

## Why migrate from Prefect to Mage Pro?

Prefect is a powerful orchestration tool, but it wasn't designed for:

- Visual pipeline development and debugging  
- Native data integration (ETL/ELT workflows)  
- Mixing SQL and Python naturally in the same pipeline  
- Streaming or event-driven data processing  
- Built-in data previews and interactive development  
- AI-powered pipeline development  

Mage Pro is built to solve these challenges out-of-the-box, combining orchestration with data engineering capabilities in a modern, developer-friendly platform.

## Step-by-Step Migration Instructions

<Steps>

1. **Inventory your Prefect flows**  
   - List your active flows and their task types:
     - `@flow` and `@task` decorators  
     - Prefect blocks (storage, infrastructure)  
     - Dependencies and scheduling logic  
   - Identify data sources, transformations, and destinations

2. **Create a workspace in Mage Pro**  
   - Visit [Mage Pro](https://cloud.mage.ai) and sign in  
   - (Optional) Connect your Git repo for version control  
   - Set up your deployment configuration using the **Deployment App** in the UI

3. **Recreate your Prefect flows as Mage pipelines**  
   - Each Prefect **flow** → 1 Mage pipeline  
   - Each Prefect **task** → 1 Mage block:
     - `@task` with data loading → **Data loader block**  
     - `@task` with transformations → **Transformer block** (Python or SQL)  
     - `@task` with data writing → **Data exporter block**  
     - Prefect blocks (storage) → **Data loader/exporter blocks**  
   - Define dependencies visually using the UI (no decorators needed)

4. **Configure scheduling and triggers**  
   - Prefect deployments → Mage **triggers** (cron, interval, or event-based)  
   - Prefect schedules → Mage **schedule triggers**  
   - Configure schedules via UI or YAML

5. **Run and validate pipelines**  
   - Use Mage Pro's UI to test individual blocks  
   - Preview dataframes, logs, and outputs at each step  
   - Compare results to your Prefect flows

6. **Monitor, scale, and automate**  
   - Monitor pipeline runs and resource usage  
   - Set alerts and retry rules  
   - Mage Pro autoscaling handles executor resources automatically on Kubernetes or Docker
   - Use the **Deployment App** to manage deployments and rollbacks

</Steps>

## Mapping Prefect Concepts to Mage Pro

### Flows → Pipelines

**Prefect:**
```python
from prefect import flow, task

@flow(name="my-etl-flow")
def my_etl_flow():
    data = extract_data()
    transformed = transform_data(data)
    load_data(transformed)
```

**Mage Pro:**
- Create a new **pipeline** in the UI
- Add blocks visually or via code
- Dependencies are defined by connecting blocks in the UI

### Tasks → Blocks

**Prefect:**
```python
@task
def extract_data():
    return pd.read_csv("data.csv")

@task
def transform_data(df):
    return df.dropna()

@task
def load_data(df):
    df.to_sql("table", engine)
```

**Mage Pro:**
- `extract_data` → **Data loader block** (Python or connector)
- `transform_data` → **Transformer block** (Python, SQL, or dbt block)
- `load_data` → **Data exporter block** (Python or connector)

### Prefect Blocks → Mage Blocks

| Prefect Block Type | Mage Pro Equivalent |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| `S3Block`, `GCSBlock` | **Data loader/exporter blocks** with native S3/GCS connectors |
| `PostgresBlock`, `SnowflakeBlock` | **Data loader/exporter blocks** with database connectors |
| `DockerBlock`, `KubernetesJob` | **Executor configuration** in pipeline settings |

### Scheduling & Deployments

**Prefect:**
```python
from prefect import serve
from prefect.schedules import CronSchedule

@flow
def scheduled_flow():
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    scheduled_flow.serve(
        cron=CronSchedule(cron="0 0 * * *")
    )
```

**Mage Pro:**
- Create a **schedule trigger** in the pipeline UI
- Configure cron expression, interval, or event-based triggers
- Use the **Deployment App** to manage deployments across environments (dev, staging, prod)
- No complex deployment setup needed—triggers and deployments are configured via UI

### Secrets & Configuration

**Prefect:**
```python
from prefect.blocks.system import Secret

@task
def use_secret():
    api_key = Secret.load("my-api-key")
```

**Mage Pro:**
- Use **workspace variables** or **pipeline variables**
- Access via `variables` dictionary in blocks
- **Built-in secret manager** with encryption, or integrate with **external secret managers** (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
- Secrets are isolated per workspace and pipeline

## Tips for Migrating Complex Flows

### Handling Prefect Subflows

**Prefect:**
```python
@flow
def parent_flow():
    result = subflow()

@flow
def subflow():
    ...
```

**Mage Pro:**
- Split into **separate pipelines** and trigger them via API or use **dynamic blocks** for conditional logic
- Use **block groups** to organize related blocks within a pipeline

### Prefect Task Runners & Concurrency

**Prefect:**
```python
from prefect.task_runners import ConcurrentTaskRunner

@flow(task_runner=ConcurrentTaskRunner())
def parallel_flow():
    ...
```

**Mage Pro:**
- Configure **concurrency settings** in pipeline configuration
- Blocks with no dependencies run in parallel automatically
- Use **executor configuration** for custom parallelism on Kubernetes or Docker

### Prefect Retries & Error Handling

**Prefect:**
```python
@task(retries=3, retry_delay_seconds=60)
def risky_task():
    ...
```

**Mage Pro:**
- Configure **retry settings** in block or pipeline configuration
- Set retry count, delay, and backoff strategy
- Built-in error handling and alerting

### Prefect Caching

**Prefect:**
```python
@task(cache_key_fn=task_input_hash, cache_expiration=timedelta(hours=1))
def cached_task():
    ...
```

**Mage Pro:**
- Use **block output caching** in pipeline settings
- Configure cache expiration and invalidation rules
- Preview cached outputs in the UI
