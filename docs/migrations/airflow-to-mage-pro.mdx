sidebarTitle: "Airflow to Mage Pro"
---
Many teams start with Apache Airflow for orchestration‚Äîbut soon encounter challenges with scalability, debugging, and developer productivity. Mage Pro offers a modern alternative: visual pipelines, built-in observability, and AI-assisted development, with zero DevOps overhead.

## Why migrate from Airflow to Mage Pro?

Airflow is a powerful scheduler, but it wasn't designed for:

- Debugging pipelines visually  
- Mixing SQL and Python naturally  
- Streaming or event-driven workflows  
- Managing secrets, Git, or multi-tenant workspaces  
- AI-powered pipeline development  

Mage Pro is built to solve these challenges out-of-the-box, with a modern developer experience and enterprise-grade scalability.

## ‚ú® Mage Pro vs Airflow: Benefits Overview

Mage Pro goes far beyond orchestration. It‚Äôs a unified platform for **data integration**, **SQL modeling (dbt-like blocks)**, **AI-powered transformation**, and **streaming pipelines** ‚Äî all within a collaborative, Git-native workspace.

| Capability | Airflow | Mage Pro |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Visual pipeline UI** | ‚ùå Code-only (Jinja, Python) | ‚úÖ Drag-and-drop editor |
| **Built-in lineage** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Plugin-based (e.g., OpenLineage) | ‚úÖ Native, auto-generated |
| **AI assistance** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Generate, fix, and explain code with AI Sidekick |
| **Multi-language support** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Python only by default | ‚úÖ SQL, Python, streaming, APIs |
| **Data integration pipelines** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom Python or 3rd-party plugins | ‚úÖ Native connectors for databases, files, APIs |
| **SQL block support** | ‚ö†Ô∏è SQLOperator runs raw strings only | ‚úÖ dbt-style SQL blocks with `ref()`, preview, and test support |
| **Incremental modeling** | ‚ùå (requires custom logic) | ‚úÖ Native in SQL block config |
| **Environment isolation** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Airflow deployments per team | ‚úÖ Per-workspace configs, secrets, variables |
| **Git integration** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual DAG sync | ‚úÖ Git-backed version control and CI/CD |
| **Scheduling & triggers** | ‚úÖ Cron + sensors | ‚úÖ Cron, events, file triggers, webhooks |
| **Secrets management** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Vault or plugins | ‚úÖ Built-in across workspaces and pipelines |
| **RBAC & SSO** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual plugins / external auth | ‚úÖ Built-in, enterprise-ready |
| **Observability & logging** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Prometheus, Grafana, etc. | ‚úÖ Native UI for logs, metrics, traces |
| **Scalability** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual tuning of workers and queues | ‚úÖ Auto-scaled executors on K8s or ECS |
| **Streaming support** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Kafka, CDC, real-time ingestion |
| **Data previews & interactive runs** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Preview data at every step |
| **Team collaboration** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Airflow not multi-tenant | ‚úÖ Workspaces, permissions, activity logs |

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Migration Instructions

<Steps>

1. **Inventory your Airflow DAGs**  
   - List your active DAGs and their task types:
     - `PythonOperator`, `BashOperator`, `SQLOperator`, etc.  
   - Identify dependencies and scheduling logic

2. **Create a cluster in Mage Pro**  
   - Visit [Mage Pro](https://cloud.mage.ai) and sign in  
   - (Optional) Connect your Git repo for version control

3. **Recreate your DAGs as Mage pipelines**  
   - Each Airflow DAG ‚Üí 1 Mage pipeline  
   - Each Airflow task ‚Üí 1 Mage block:
     - `PythonOperator` ‚Üí Python block  
     - `SQLOperator` ‚Üí SQL block  
     - `BranchOperator` ‚Üí Dynamic block  
     - `Sensor` ‚Üí Trigger block  
   - Define dependencies visually using the UI

4. **Configure scheduling and triggers**  
   - Use cron, interval, or event-based triggers  
   - Configure schedules via UI or YAML

5. **Run and validate pipelines**  
   - Use Mage Pro‚Äôs UI to test individual blocks  
   - Preview dataframes, logs, and outputs  
   - Compare results to your Airflow jobs

6. **Monitor, scale, and automate**  
   - Monitor pipeline runs and resource usage  
   - Set alerts and retry rules  
   - Mage Pro autoscaling handles executor resources automatically

</Steps>

## ü§ñ Convert Airflow DAGs with AI Sidekick

Skip the manual rewrites ‚Äî Mage Pro‚Äôs **AI Sidekick** can automatically convert your Airflow DAG code into a Mage pipeline with just one prompt.

### üîß How to Use It

1. Click the **‚ÄúAsk AI‚Äù** button in the top-right corner of the Mage Pro UI.  
2. Paste your Airflow DAG code ‚Äî including `@dag`, `@task`, or `PythonOperator`-based workflows.  
3. Ask: **‚ÄúConvert this Airflow DAG to a Mage pipeline.‚Äù**  
4. Sidekick will:
   - Parse the DAG structure and task relationships  
   - Generate the corresponding Mage blocks (Python, SQL, dynamic, trigger)  
   - Define block dependencies and scheduling logic  
5. Review and insert the generated pipeline directly into your project.

### üí° Why Use Sidekick?

- **Faster migration**: turn entire DAGs into Mage pipelines in seconds  
- **Less error-prone**: Sidekick understands scheduling, dependencies, and operator types  
- **Context-aware**: uses your project setup and prior block structure  
- **Fully editable**: review, tweak, and insert blocks before saving  

üëâ Learn more in the [AI Sidekick docs](/ai/sidekick).

## üß† Tips for Migrating Complex DAGs

- Split large DAGs into smaller, modular pipelines  
- Use **global variables** or **shared outputs** to pass data between blocks  
- Replace Airflow SubDAGs with **block groups**  
- Use **dynamic blocks** to support branching and conditional logic
