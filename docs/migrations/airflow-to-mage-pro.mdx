sidebarTitle: "Airflow to Mage Pro"
---
Many teams start with Apache Airflow for orchestration—but soon encounter challenges with scalability, debugging, and developer productivity. Mage Pro offers a modern alternative: visual pipelines, built-in observability, and AI-assisted development, with zero DevOps overhead.

## Why migrate from Airflow to Mage Pro?

Airflow is a powerful scheduler, but it wasn't designed for:

- Debugging pipelines visually  
- Mixing SQL and Python naturally  
- Streaming or event-driven workflows  
- Managing secrets, Git, or multi-tenant workspaces  
- AI-powered pipeline development  

Mage Pro is built to solve these challenges out-of-the-box, with a modern developer experience and enterprise-grade scalability.

## ✨ Mage Pro vs Airflow: Benefits Overview

Mage Pro goes far beyond orchestration. It’s a unified platform for **data integration**, **SQL modeling (dbt-like blocks)**, **AI-powered transformation**, and **streaming pipelines** — all within a collaborative, Git-native workspace.

| Capability | Airflow | Mage Pro |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Visual pipeline UI** | ❌ Code-only (Jinja, Python) | ✅ Hybrid UI: drag-and-drop DAG builder + notebook-style coding experience |
| **Built-in lineage** | ⚠️ Plugin-based (e.g., OpenLineage) | ✅ Native, auto-generated |
| **AI assistance** | ❌ | ✅ Generate, fix, and explain code with AI Sidekick |
| **Multi-language support** | ⚠️ Python only by default | ✅ SQL, Python, streaming, APIs |
| **Data integration pipelines** | ⚠️ Custom Python or 3rd-party plugins | ✅ Native connectors for databases, files, APIs |
| **SQL block support** | ⚠️ SQLOperator runs raw strings only | ✅ dbt-style SQL blocks with `ref()`, preview, and test support |
| **Incremental modeling** | ❌ (requires custom logic) | ✅ Native in SQL block config |
| **Environment isolation** | ⚠️ Requires Airflow deployments per team | ✅ Per-workspace configs, secrets, variables |
| **Git integration** | ⚠️ Manual DAG sync | ✅ Git-backed version control and CI/CD |
| **Scheduling & triggers** | ✅ Cron + sensors | ✅ Cron, events, file triggers, webhooks |
| **Secrets management** | ⚠️ Requires Vault or plugins | ✅ Built-in across workspaces and pipelines |
| **RBAC & SSO** | ⚠️ Manual plugins / external auth | ✅ Built-in, enterprise-ready |
| **Observability & logging** | ⚠️ Requires Prometheus, Grafana, etc. | ✅ Native UI for logs, metrics, traces |
| **Scalability** | ⚠️ Manual tuning of workers and queues | ✅ Auto-scaled executors on K8s or ECS |
| **Streaming support** | ❌ | ✅ Kafka, CDC, real-time ingestion |
| **Data previews & interactive runs** | ❌ | ✅ Preview data at every step |
| **Team collaboration** | ⚠️ Airflow not multi-tenant | ✅ Workspaces, permissions, activity logs |

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Migration Instructions

<Steps>

1. **Inventory your Airflow DAGs**  
   - List your active DAGs and their task types:
     - `PythonOperator`, `BashOperator`, `SQLOperator`, etc.  
   - Identify dependencies and scheduling logic

2. **Create a cluster in Mage Pro**  
   - Visit [Mage Pro](https://cloud.mage.ai) and sign in  
   - (Optional) Connect your Git repo for version control

3. **Recreate your DAGs as Mage pipelines**  
   - Each Airflow DAG → 1 Mage pipeline  
   - Each Airflow task → 1 Mage block:
     - `PythonOperator` → Python block  
     - `SQLOperator` → SQL block  
     - `BranchOperator` → Dynamic block  
     - `Sensor` → Trigger block  
   - Define dependencies visually using the UI

4. **Configure scheduling and triggers**  
   - Use cron, interval, or event-based triggers  
   - Configure schedules via UI or YAML

5. **Run and validate pipelines**  
   - Use Mage Pro’s UI to test individual blocks  
   - Preview dataframes, logs, and outputs  
   - Compare results to your Airflow jobs

6. **Monitor, scale, and automate**  
   - Monitor pipeline runs and resource usage  
   - Set alerts and retry rules  
   - Mage Pro autoscaling handles executor resources automatically

</Steps>

## 🤖 Convert Airflow DAGs with AI Sidekick

Skip the manual rewrites — Mage Pro’s **AI Sidekick** can automatically convert your Airflow DAG code into a Mage pipeline with just one prompt.

### 🔧 How to Use It

1. Click the **“Ask AI”** button in the top-right corner of the Mage Pro UI.  
2. Paste your Airflow DAG code — including `@dag`, `@task`, or `PythonOperator`-based workflows.  
3. Ask: **“Convert this Airflow DAG to a Mage pipeline.”**  
4. Sidekick will:
   - Parse the DAG structure and task relationships  
   - Generate the corresponding Mage blocks (Python, SQL, dynamic, trigger)  
   - Define block dependencies and scheduling logic  
5. Review and insert the generated pipeline directly into your project.

### 💡 Why Use Sidekick?

- **Faster migration**: turn entire DAGs into Mage pipelines in seconds  
- **Less error-prone**: Sidekick understands scheduling, dependencies, and operator types  
- **Context-aware**: uses your project setup and prior block structure  
- **Fully editable**: review, tweak, and insert blocks before saving  

👉 Learn more in the [AI Sidekick docs](/ai/sidekick).

## 🧠 Tips for Migrating Complex DAGs

- Split large DAGs into smaller, modular pipelines  
- Use **global variables** or **shared outputs** to pass data between blocks  
- Replace Airflow SubDAGs with **block groups**  
- Use **dynamic blocks** to support branching and conditional logic

## ✅ After Migration: What You Get with Mage Pro

- AI-powered block generation and debugging (via AI Sidekick)  
- Visual pipeline builder and real-time logs  
- Git-backed version control and CI/CD  
- Built-in access controls, audit logs, and workspace isolation  
- Support for SQL, Python, streaming, dbt, Delta Lake, Iceberg, and more
