Many teams start with Airbyte for data integration—but soon encounter challenges with flexibility, orchestration, and observability. Mage Pro offers a unified alternative: a single platform for data integration, transformation, and orchestration with **AI-assisted pipeline development** and **enterprise-ready scalability**.

## Why migrate from Airbyte to Mage Pro?

Airbyte is popular for ELT pipelines, but it wasn't designed for:

- Native orchestration of transformations  
- Visual, modular pipeline building  
- AI-powered debugging and code generation  
- Git-native CI/CD and multi-environment deployments  
- Streaming pipelines and event triggers  

Mage Pro replaces Airbyte’s connector-based model with **end-to-end data integration pipelines** that seamlessly combine **extract, load, and transform steps**—all while giving teams full code flexibility and better observability.

## ✨ Mage Pro vs Airbyte: Benefits Overview

Mage Pro combines [**data integration**](/data-integrations/overview) and [**data orchestration**](/orchestration/triggers/triggering-pipelines) in a single, developer-friendly platform.

| Capability | Airbyte | Mage Pro |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Data integration** | ✅ Pre-built connectors | ✅ Native connectors for APIs, databases, files |
| **Orchestration** | ⚠️ Basic scheduling only | ✅ Full DAG-level orchestration |
| **Visual pipeline UI** | ⚠️ Connector-based only | ✅ Drag-and-drop pipeline builder |
| **Custom transformations** | ⚠️ Limited (requires dbt or custom code) | ✅ Python, SQL, or AI-generated transformations |
| **AI assistance** | ❌ | ✅ Generate, debug, and optimize pipelines with AI Sidekick |
| **Incremental loads** | ✅ Supported via config | ✅ Supported natively in pipeline settings |
| **Schema discovery & testing** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Data previews, schema validation, tests |
| **Streaming & CDC** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Native support for Kafka, CDC, and real-time ingestion |
| **Git integration** | ⚠️ Manual export/import only | ✅ Git-backed pipelines and CI/CD |
| **Secrets management** | ⚠️ Env-only | ✅ Built-in secrets & workspace isolation |
| **Multi-environment support** | ❌ Manual, not native | ✅ Dev, staging, and production workspaces |
| **Observability** | ⚠️ Basic logs | ✅ Detailed logs, lineage, and monitoring |
| **Scalability** | ⚠️ Self-managed in OSS, limited control in Cloud | ✅ Auto-scaled executors on Kubernetes or ECS |

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Migration Instructions

<Steps>

1. **Inventory your Airbyte connectors**  
   - List all sources and destinations in your Airbyte setup  
   - Note incremental or full-load settings  
   - Export transformation logic (e.g., dbt, SQL scripts)

2. **Create a Mage Pro workspace**  
   - Sign up at [Mage Pro](https://cloud.mage.ai)  
   - (Optional) Connect your Git repository for version control

3. **Recreate connectors as Mage data integration blocks**  
   - Each Airbyte source → **Extract block** in Mage  
   - Each Airbyte destination → **Load block** in Mage  
   - Any dbt or SQL logic → **SQL block** (dbt-like features built-in)  
   - Use **Python blocks** for custom transformations

4. **Configure pipelines**  
   - Combine extract → transform → load in a single pipeline  
   - Use the visual editor or YAML pipeline config

5. **Set up scheduling and triggers**  
   - Replace Airbyte sync schedules with Mage cron or event-based triggers  
   - Optionally add webhooks or file-based triggers

6. **Run and validate pipelines**  
   - Preview data outputs at every step  
   - Compare final tables and schema to ensure parity  
   - Validate incremental load and deduplication logic

7. **Monitor and optimize**  
   - Use Mage’s built-in logs and data lineage  
   - Configure alerts and retry rules  
   - Leverage auto-scaling for parallel extracts and loads

</Steps>

## 🤖 Convert Airbyte Configs with AI Sidekick

Mage Pro’s **AI Sidekick** can automatically help convert Airbyte connector configurations and dbt logic into Mage pipelines.

### 🔧 How to Use It

1. Open your Mage Pro workspace and click **“Ask AI”**  
2. Paste your Airbyte connector settings or dbt SQL models  
3. Ask: **“Convert this Airbyte source-destination flow into a Mage pipeline.”**  
4. Sidekick will:
   - Generate Extract/Load blocks for your sources and targets  
   - Translate transformation steps into SQL or Python blocks  
   - Create a complete pipeline with triggers and dependencies  
5. Insert the generated pipeline directly into your workspace.

## 🧠 Tips for Migrating Complex Airbyte Flows

- Merge multiple Airbyte connectors into a **single end-to-end pipeline**  
- Use **pipeline variables** for shared config (e.g., table names, batch sizes)  
- Replace dbt transformations with **SQL blocks** (supports `ref()`, tests, and incremental models)  
- For large tables, enable **batching and streaming modes**

---

## ✅ After Migration: What You Gain

- Unified **integration + transformation + orchestration**  
- Visual pipelines and instant debugging  
- AI-powered pipeline creation and troubleshooting  
- Git-based CI/CD and environment isolation  
- Real-time streaming support (Kafka, CDC, webhooks)  
- Enterprise-grade RBAC, audit logs, and observability  

> No more juggling Airbyte, Airflow, and dbt. With Mage Pro, you get a single platform for all data workflows.
