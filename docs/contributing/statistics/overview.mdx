## 🙏 Why is this important?

By opting into sending usage statistics to [Mage](https://www.mage.ai/),
it’ll help the team and community of contributors (Magers) learn what’s going wrong with the tool
and what improvements can be made.

In addition to helping reduce potential errors,
you’ll help inform which features are useful and which need work.
