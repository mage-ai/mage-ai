## Push code changes

* Fork the Mage github repo: https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai
* Create a branch in your forked repo and commit your changes
* Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) 
* Tag Mage team members for PR review (@wangxiaoyou1993, @dy46, @johnson-mage, @tommydangerous)

## Debugging

Instead of using `breakpoint()`, add the following line to your code where you
want a debug:

```python
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

Attach to running container to use debugger. To get the container ID, run
`docker ps` and look in the `NAMES` column.

```bash
docker attach [container_id]
```

## Troubleshoot

### Permission denied

If you get an error relating to permission denied when trying to execute a script,
it might have something to do with SELinux.

Two or more containers are trying to mount the same volume. With SELinux it’s not possible without
the `z` option.

For more information about using the `z` option,
read [Docker’s documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/).

### No such file or directory for "install_and_run.sh" file

If you are using a Windows machine and run into the following error while executing the
`docker-compose.yml` file: `exec ./scripts/install_and_run.sh: no such file or directory`,
it may be due to a difference in line-endings used on Windows versus Macs.

You can check the `mage_ai/frontend/scripts/install_and_run.sh` file in VSCode to see if
it is using CRLFs (carriage return line feeds), and if it is, change it to LFs (line feeds)
and save the file. Then try running the `docker-compose` command again.
