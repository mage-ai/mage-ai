## Push code changes

* Fork the Mage github repo: https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai
* Create a branch in your forked repo and commit your changes
* Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) 
* Tag Mage team members for PR review (@wangxiaoyou1993, @dy46, @johnson-mage, @tommydangerous)

## Debugging

Instead of using `breakpoint()`, add the following line to your code where you
want a debug:

```python
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

Attach to running container to use debugger. To get the container ID, run
`docker ps` and look in the `NAMES` column.

```bash
docker attach [container_id]
```

## Troubleshoot

### Permission denied

If you get an error relating to permission denied when trying to execute a script,
it might have something to do with SELinux.

Two or more containers are trying to mount the same volume. With SELinux it’s not possible without
the `z` option.

For more information about using the `z` option,
read [Docker’s documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/).
