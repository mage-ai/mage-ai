title: "Create a new source"
description: "This guide details adding a new source to Mage. If your source already exists as a [Singer tap](https://www.singer.io/#taps), check out [our guide](/contributing/data-integrations/adapt-existing-source) for adapting an existing source instead."
---

Mage Sources are built on Singer Taps. You can read more about the Singer spec [here](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started). In this guide, we'll copy over our sample source to get started and build from there. 

If you haven't already, start by cloning the Mage repo and navigating to the folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai.git
cd mage-ai
```

For our source, we'll need:

- A schema that represents the source data
- A template configuration file
- An `__init__.py` file that contains the logic for fetching data from the source.
  - A `test_connection` method that tests the connection to our source.
  - A `discover` method that returns a [Catalog](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/blob/master/mage_integrations/mage_integrations/sources/catalog.py) of streams.
  - A `load_data` method that yields data from the source as a dictionary.

We'll start from a template to make things easy.

## Copy the template source

Navigate to `/mage-ai/mage_integrations/mage_integrations/sources` and create a copy of the `titanic` directory:

```bash
cd ./mage_integrations/mage_integrations/sources
cp -R titanic MY_SOURCE
```

Our titanic source simply reads data from a CSV file, but we'll modify it to do much more. You'll notice the following files and folders in the `MY_SOURCE` directory:

```
mage_integrations/sources/MY_SOURCE
├── README.md
├── __init__.py
├── schemas
│   └── passengers.json
└── templates
    └── config.json
```

So we'll need to update or overwrite each of these.

## Update schemas

This folder contains all the known schemas from your source. For sources that have dynamic schemas (e.g. database tables from MySQL), this folder may be empty since the schema is dependent on the individual's source data.

The JSON format of these schema files follows the [Singer spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/DISCOVERY_MODE.md#schemas).

When naming schemas, use the plural name of the object you're referencing. This plural name will be displayed to the individual who is setting up a synchronization using this source. Take the [sample "passengers" schema](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/tree/master/mage_integrations/mage_integrations/sources/titanic/schemas/passengers.json) for example:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "Survived": {
      "type": ["null", "integer"]
    },
    "Name": {
      "type": ["null", "string"]
    }
  },
  "type": ["null", "object"]
}
```

## Add templates

This folder contains a sample configuration JSON file that's displayed to the user when they are setting up a synchronization using this source.

The `config.json` file contains keys and values that are used to configure the behavior of the source as well as credentials to authenticate requests to the source. You must use the exact filename `config.json`, regardless of your source's name.

The following simple example is present in the [Titanic source](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/tree/master/mage_integrations/mage_integrations/sources/titanic/templates/config.json).

```json
{
  "api_key": "",
  "secret_key": ""
}
```

## Update `__init__.py`

A majority of source logic lives in the `__init__.py` file. Most of the work in adding your own source will involve creating/overwriting methods from `__init__.py`. [Our sample](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/tree/master/mage_integrations/mage_integrations/sources/titanic/__init__.py) contains the following:

```python
from mage_integrations.sources.base import Source, main
from typing import Dict, Generator, List
import requests


URL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mage-ai/datasets/master/titanic_survival.csv'

class Titanic(Source):

    def load_data(
        self,
        **kwargs,
    ) -> Generator[List[Dict], None, None]:
        text = requests.get(URL).text

        rows = []
        lines = text.rstrip().split('\n')
        columns = lines[0].split(',')

        for line in lines[1:]:
            values = line.split(',')
            rows.append({col: values[idx] for idx, col in enumerate(columns)})

        yield rows

    def test_connection(self):
        request = requests.get(URL)

        if request.status_code != 200:
            raise Exception('Could not fetch titanic data')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main(Titanic)
```

### Rename source class

First, rename the source class to match your new source

```python
from mage_integrations.sources.base import Source

class MY_SOURCE(Source):
    pass
```

### Edit methods

#### The `load_data()` method

Override this method to contain the logic for fetching data specific to your source. The `Titanic` source's `load_data` method reads data from a CSV file and yields a list of dictionaries:

```python
def load_data(
    self,
    **kwargs,
) -> Generator[List[Dict], None, None]:
    url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mage-ai/datasets/master/titanic_survival.csv'
    text = requests.get(url).text
    rows = []
    lines = text.rstrip().split('\n')
    columns = lines[0].split(',')
    for line in lines[1:]:
        values = line.split(',')
        rows.append({col: values[idx] for idx, col in enumerate(columns)})
    yield rows
```

Your `load_data` method should _also_ yield a list of dictionaries. There is a keyword argument named `query` in the `load_data` method that is a dictionary. When Mage runs a source, the following keys and values are automatically available on each run:

| Key                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Sample value                                    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `_execution_date`      | The date and time (in ISO format) of when the pipeline started running.                                                                                                                                                                                   | `2022-10-21T17:24:49.443559`                    |
| `_execution_partition` | An automatically formatted partition of the pipeline run using the execution date.                                                                                                                                                                        | `20221021T172557` (e.g. format `%Y%m%dT%H%M%S`) |
| `_start_date`          | You can define this variable as a [runtime variable](/getting-started/runtime-variable) in your pipeline or it'll be automatically filled in using the date and time your pipeline runs minus 1 hour, day, week, etc (based on your schedule's interval). | `2022-10-01T00:00:00.000000`                    |
| `_end_date`            | You can define this variable as a [runtime variable](/getting-started/runtime-variable) in your pipeline or it'll be automatically filled in using the date and time your pipeline runs.                                                                  | `2022-10-02T00:00:00.000000`                    |

#### The `discover()` method

The discover method should return a [Catalog](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/blob/master/mage_integrations/mage_integrations/sources/catalog.py) of streams that define the data in your source. For example discover methods, see our [Google Sheets](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/blob/master/mage_integrations/mage_integrations/sources/google_sheets/__init__.py) source or our [DynamoDB source](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/blob/master/mage_integrations/mage_integrations/sources/dynamodb/__init__.py).

#### The `test_connection()` method

<Snippet file="test-connection.mdx"/>

### Update `main()` function

Change the source name in the `main()` function to match your new source:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main(MY_SOURCE)
```

## Add your source to the UI

The list of sources is available [here](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/blob/master/mage_ai/data_integrations/sources/constants.py), add yours to make it accessible via the UI.

## Document your source

Document how to configure and use your source in the `README.md` file at the source's root directory. Documentation helps Magers and future contributor understand exactly how your source works! Be sure to be thorough and descriptive. [Here's an example](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/blob/master/mage_integrations/mage_integrations/sources/salesforce/README.md) of documentation done well.

## Test your source

You'll first need to configure your [development environment](https://docs.mage.ai/contributing/development-environment). Once complete, follow this [doc](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/tree/master/mage_integrations) to test your new source.
