description:
  "Once youâ€™re done transforming your data, write code in these types of blocks to
  store that data or to train models and store those models elsewhere."

## Example

```python
from mage_ai.io.file import FileIO
from pandas import DataFrame


@data_exporter
def export_data_to_file(df: DataFrame, **kwargs):
    filepath = 'path/to/write/dataframe/to.csv'
    FileIO().export(df, filepath)
```
