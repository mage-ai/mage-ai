title: "Sensor"
description: "A sensor is a block that continuously evaluates a condition until it’s met or until a period of time has elapsed."
---

If there is a block with a sensor as an upstream dependency, that block won’t start running until the sensor has evaluated its condition successfully.

## Example

You can add sensors to a pipeline the same way you add other types of blocks.

```python
from mage_ai.orchestration.run_status_checker import check_status


@sensor
def check_condition(**kwargs) -> bool:
    return check_status(
        'pipeline_uuid',
        kwargs['execution_date'],
        block_uuid='block_uuid',
    )
```
