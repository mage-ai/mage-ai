description: "Write your code for fetching data from a remote source or loading it from disk."

## Example

```python
import io
import pandas as pd
import requests


@data_loader
def load_data_from_api(*args, **kwargs):
    url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mage-ai/datasets/master/restaurant_user_transactions.csv'

    response = requests.get(url)
    return pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(response.text), sep=',')
```

## How data is passed to other blocks

The object that is returned from the decorated function (e.g. `load_data_from_api`)
will be made available in all blocks that depend on this block.

## Templates

To read about Mage's data loading clients that interface with popular data
storage systems, see docs on [Data loading](/design/data-loading).
