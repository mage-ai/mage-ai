description: "Use these blocks to clean, transform, and enhance data from other blocks."

## Example

```python
from pandas import DataFrame


@transformer
def transform_df(df: DataFrame, *args, **kwargs) -> DataFrame:
    return df.iloc[:10]
```

## How data is received from upstream blocks

All blocks (except Scratchpads and Sensors) pass their data from the return statement in their
decorated function to all their downstream blocks.

In order to access the data from an upstream block within a current block,
use the positional arguments of the decorated function.

For example, in the above function named `transform_df`, the output data from its upstream block
is accessed by the positional argument named `df`.

## Getting data from multiple upstream blocks

If a block has more than 1 upstream block,
then each upstream blockâ€™s output is accessible via positional arguments.

For example, if you have 3 upstream blocks,
than there will be 3 positional arguments available within the `transform_df` function.

See below for an example:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame
import pandas as pd


@transformer
def transform_df(df1, df2, df3, **kwargs) -> DataFrame:
    return pd.concat([df1, df2, df3])
```
