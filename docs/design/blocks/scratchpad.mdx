Scratchpad blocks aren't used when executing a pipeline.

![Blocks](https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/blocks/scratchpad.gif?raw=true)

## Getting data from other blocks

If you want to read the output data from another block, use the following sample code:

```python
from mage_ai.data_preparation.variable_manager import get_variable


df = get_variable('pipelined_uuid', 'block_uuid', 'output_0')
```

- Change the value of `pipelined_uuid` to match your current pipeline UUID.
- Change the value of `block_uuid` to match the UUID of the block you want to read data from.
