### 💻 Easy developer experience

Open-source engine that comes with a custom notebook UI for building data
pipelines.

- Mage comes with a specialized notebook UI for building data pipelines.

- Use Python and SQL (more languages coming soon) together in the same pipeline
  for ultimate flexibility.

- Set up locally and get started developing with a single command.

- Deploying to production is fast using native integrations with major cloud
  providers.

### 🚢 Engineering best practices built-in

Build and deploy data pipelines using modular code. No more writing throwaway
code or trying to turn notebooks into scripts.

- Writing reusable code is easy because every block in your data pipeline is a
  standalone file.

- Data validation is written into each block and tested every time a block is
  run.

- Operationalizing your data pipelines is easy with built-in observability, data
  quality monitoring, and lineage.

- Each block of code has a single responsibility: load data from a source,
  transform data, or export data anywhere.

### 💳 Data is a first class citizen

Designed from the ground up specifically for running data-intensive workflows.

- Every block run produces a data product (e.g. dataset, unstructured data,
  etc.)

- Every data product can be automatically partitioned.

- Each pipeline and data product can be versioned.

- Backfilling data products is a core function and operation.

### 🪐 Scaling is made simple

Analyze and process large data quickly for rapid iteration.

- Transform very large datasets through a native integration with Spark.

- Handle data intensive transformations with built-in distributed computing
  (e.g. Dask, Ray) \[coming soon\].

- Run thousands of pipelines simultaneously and manage transparently through a
  collaborative UI.

- Execute SQL queries in your data warehouse to process heavy workloads.
