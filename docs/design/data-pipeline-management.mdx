## Setup

If you haven’t setup a project before, check out the
[setup guide](/getting-started/setup) before starting.

## Pipelines

<sub>`http://localhost:3000/pipelines`</sub>

This page will show all the pipelines in your project.

> Core abstraction: [Pipeline](/design/core-abstractions#pipeline)
>
> A pipeline contains references to all the blocks of code you want to run,
> charts for visualizing data, and organizes the dependency between each block
> of code.

![Pipelines](https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/pipelines/pipelines-index.jpg?raw=true)

Learn more about
[**projects and pipelines here**](/design/core-abstractions#project).

From this page, you can also create a new pipeline by clicking the

**`[+ New pipeline]`** button.

#### Creating new pipeline

Creating a new pipeline will take you to the **Pipeline edit page**; a
notebook-like experience for adding blocks, creating dependencies between
blocks, testing code, and visualizing data with charts.

## Pipeline runs

<sub>
  [`http://localhost:3000/pipeline-runs`](http://localhost:3000/pipeline-runs)
</sub>

View all the runs for every pipeline in your current project.

>
> A run record stores information about when it was started, its status, when it
> was completed, any runtime variables used in the execution of the pipeline or
> block, etc.

## Pipeline detail

<sub>`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/[uuid]`</sub>

This page contains all the information and history for a single pipeline:

1. [Triggers](/design/core-abstractions#trigger)
1. [Runs](/design/core-abstractions#run)
1. [Logs](/design/core-abstractions#log)

## Triggers

<sub>
  [`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/triggers`](http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/triggers)
</sub>

This page shows all the active and inactive triggers for a single pipeline.

> Core abstraction: [Trigger](/design/core-abstractions#trigger)
>
> A trigger is a set of instructions that determine when or how a pipeline
> should run.

![Pipeline detail](https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/pipelines/pipeline-detail.jpg?raw=true)

---

#### Create trigger

<sub>`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/[uuid]/triggers/[id]/edit`</sub>

Create a new trigger for this pipeline by clicking the **`[+ Create]`** button
near the top of the page.

You can configure the trigger to run the pipeline on a schedule, when an event
occurs, or when an API is called.

> Core abstraction: [Schedule](/design/core-abstractions#schedule)
>
> A schedule type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run after a start date
> and on a set interval.

---

> Core abstraction: [Event](/design/core-abstractions#event)
>
> An event type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run whenever a specific
> event occurs.

---

> Core abstraction: [API](/design/core-abstractions#api)
>
> An API trigger will instruct the pipeline to run whenever a specific API
> is called.

![Trigger create](https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/pipelines/trigger-create.jpg?raw=true)

<sub>

---

#### Trigger detail

On this page, you can start or pause the trigger. Starting the trigger will make
it active. Pausing the trigger will prevent it from running the pipeline.

<Note>
  If you have other triggers for this pipeline, pausing 1 trigger may not stop
  the pipeline from running since other triggers can also run the pipeline.
</Note>

You can also edit the trigger after creating it by clicking the

**`[Edit trigger]`** button.

## Logs

<sub>
  [`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/logs`](http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/logs)
</sub>

Browse all logs for a pipeline. You can search and filter logs by log level,
block type, block UUID, and more.

> Core abstraction: [**Log**](/design/core-abstractions#log)
>
> A log is a file that contains system output information.

## Monitor

You can monitor many metrics for each of your pipelines and blocks. Soon, you’ll
be able to monitor aggregate metrics across all pipelines and blocks.

## Concurrency

You can limit the concurrency of the block execution to reduce resource consumption.

### Global concurrency
You can configure the maximum number of concurrent block runs in project’s metadata.yaml via queue_config.

```yaml
queue_config:
  concurrency: 100
```
The default value of concurrency is 20.

### Pipeline level concurrency
You can edit the `concurrency_config` in each pipeline's metadata.yaml file to enforce pipeline level concurrency.
Here is the example:
```yaml
concurrency_config:
  block_run_limit: 5
  pipeline_run_limit: 3
```
* `block_run_limit` is to limit the concurrent blocks runs in one pipeline run.
* `pipeline_run_limit` is to limit the concurrent pipeline runs in one pipeline trigger.


## Variable storage
Mage automatically persists the output of block runs on disk. You can specify the path or the storage for block output variables
in the following ways.
* Specify the data directory path via `MAGE_DATA_DIR` environment variable. If you use Mage docker image, this environment
  variable is set to `/home/src/mage_data` by default.
* If the `MAGE_DATA_DIR` environment variable is not set, you can set the `variables_dir` path in project's metadata.yaml. Here is
  an example:
  ```yaml
  variables_dir: /home/src/mage_data
  ```
* You can also use an external storage to store the block output variables by specifying the `remote_variables_dir` path in project's
  metadata.yaml.
  * AWS S3 storage:
    ```yaml
    variables_dir: /home/src/mage_data
    remote_variables_dir: s3://bucket/path_prefix
    ```
  * Google Cloud Storage:
    ```yaml
    variables_dir: /home/src/mage_data
    remote_variables_dir: gs://bucket/path_prefix
    ```

## Variable retention
If you want to clean up the old variables in your variable storage, you can set the `variables_retention_period`
config in project's metadata.yaml. The valid period should end with "d", "h", or "w".

Example config:
```yaml
variables_retention_period: 30d
```

After configuring `variables_retention_period` in project's metadata.yaml, you can run the following command
to clean up old variables:
```bash
mage clean-cached-variables [project_path]
```
