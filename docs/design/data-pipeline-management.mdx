## Setup

If you haven’t setup a project before, check out the
[setup guide](/getting-started/setup) before starting.

## Pipelines

<sub>`http://localhost:3000/pipelines`</sub>

This page will show all the pipelines in your project.

> Core abstraction: [Pipeline](/design/core-abstractions#pipeline)
>
> A pipeline contains references to all the blocks of code you want to run,
> charts for visualizing data, and organizes the dependency between each block
> of code.

![Pipelines](https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/pipelines/pipelines-index.jpg?raw=true)

Learn more about
[**projects and pipelines here**](/design/core-abstractions#project).

From this page, you can also create a new pipeline by clicking the

**`[+ New pipeline]`** button.

#### Creating new pipeline

Creating a new pipeline will take you to the **Pipeline edit page**; a
notebook-like experience for adding blocks, creating dependencies between
blocks, testing code, and visualizing data with charts.

## Pipeline runs

<sub>
  [`http://localhost:3000/pipeline-runs`](http://localhost:3000/pipeline-runs)
</sub>

View all the runs for every pipeline in your current project.

> Core abstraction: [Run](/design/core-abstractions#run)
>
> A run record stores information about when it was started, its status, when it
> was completed, any runtime variables used in the execution of the pipeline or
> block, etc.

## Pipeline detail

<sub>`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/[uuid]`</sub>

This page contains all the information and history for a single pipeline:

1. [Triggers](/design/core-abstractions#trigger)
1. [Runs](/design/core-abstractions#run)
1. [Logs](/design/core-abstractions#log)

## Triggers

<sub>
  [`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/triggers`](http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/triggers)
</sub>

This page shows all the active and inactive triggers for a single pipeline.

> Core abstraction: [Trigger](/design/core-abstractions#trigger)
>
> A trigger is a set of instructions that determine when or how a pipeline
> should run.

![Pipeline detail](https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/pipelines/pipeline-detail.jpg?raw=true)

---

#### Create trigger

<sub>`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/[uuid]/triggers/[id]/edit`</sub>

Create a new trigger for this pipeline by clicking the **`[+ Create]`** button
near the top of the page.

You can configure the trigger to run the pipeline on a schedule, when an event
occurs, or when an API is called.

> Core abstraction: [Schedule](/design/core-abstractions#schedule)
>
> A schedule type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run after a start date
> and on a set interval.

---

> Core abstraction: [Event](/design/core-abstractions#event)
>
> An event type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run whenever a specific
> event occurs.

---

> Core abstraction: [API](/design/core-abstractions#api)
>
> An API trigger will instruct the pipeline to run whenever a specific API
> is called.

![Trigger create](https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/pipelines/trigger-create.jpg?raw=true)

<sub>

</sub>

---

#### Trigger detail

On this page, you can start or pause the trigger. Starting the trigger will make
it active. Pausing the trigger will prevent it from running the pipeline.

<Note>
  If you have other triggers for this pipeline, pausing 1 trigger may not stop
  the pipeline from running since other triggers can also run the pipeline.
</Note>

![Trigger detail](https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/pipelines/trigger-detail.jpg?raw=true)

You can also edit the trigger after creating it by clicking the

**`[Edit trigger]`** button.

## Logs

<sub>
  [`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/logs`](http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/logs)
</sub>

Browse all logs for a pipeline. You can search and filter logs by log level,
block type, block UUID, and more.

> Core abstraction: [**Log**](/design/core-abstractions#log)
>
> A log is a file that contains system output information.

## Monitor

You can monitor many metrics for each of your pipelines and blocks. Soon, you’ll
be able to monitor aggregate metrics across all pipelines and blocks.

/>

Read more [here](/production/observability/monitoring).


## Concurrency

You can limit the concurrency of the block execution to reduce resource consumption.

You can configure the maximum number of concurrent block runs in project’s metadata.yaml via queue_config.

```yaml
queue_config:
  concurrency: 100
```
The default value of concurrency is 20.

## Variable retention

Mage automatically persists the output of block runs on disk. If you want to clean up the old variables,
You can set the `variables_retention_period` config in project's metadata.yaml. The valid period should
end with "d", "h", or "w".

Example config:
```yaml
variables_retention_period: 30d
```

After configuring `variables_retention_period` in project's metadata.yaml, you can run the following command
to clean up old variables:
```bash
mage clean-cached-variables [project_path]
```
