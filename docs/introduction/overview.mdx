## ü¶Ñ Make data magical

We put the _fun_ in fun-ctional programming. Mage is a hybrid framework that combines the best of both worlds: the flexibility of notebooks with the rigor of modular code.

- **Extract** and synchronize data from 3rd party sources.
- **Transform** data with real-time and batch pipelines using Python, SQL, and R.
- **Load** data into your data warehouse or data lake using our pre-built connectors.
- Run, monitor, and **orchestrate** thousands of pipelines without losing sleep.

<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <Step title="üî® Build">
    Have you met anyone who loves developing in Airflow? That's why we designed an easy developer experience that you'll enjoy.

    - **Simple developer experience**: Start developing locally with a single command or launch a dev environment in your cloud using Terraform.
    - **Language of choice**: Write code in Python, SQL, or R in the same pipeline for _ultimate_ flexibility.
    - **Engineering best practices built-in**: Every step in your pipeline is a standalone file with modular code that's reusable and testable. No more DAGs with spaghetti code üçù.
    - **Bring your favorite tools:** Write [dbt](/dbt/overview) models, use your favorite [IDE](/development/text-editor), [track changes with Git](/getting-started/setting-up-git), and much much more.

    </p>
  </Step>
  <Step title="üîç Preview">
  Don't waste time waiting for your DAGs to finish testing. Get instant feedback from your code _every_ time you run it.

  - **Interactive code**: Immediately see results from your code's output with an interactive notebook UI.
  - **Data is a first-class citizen**: Each block of code in your pipeline produces data that can be versioned, partitioned, and cataloged for future use.
  - **Collaborate on cloud**: Develop collaboratively on [cloud resources](/production/deploying-to-cloud/architecture), version control with [Git](/getting-started/setting-up-git), and [test](/development/data-validation) pipelines without waiting for an available shared staging environment.

</Step>
<Step title="üöÄ Launch" >
  Don't have a large team dedicated to Airflow? Mage makes it easy for a single developer or small team to scale up and manage thousands of pipelines.

  - **Fast deploy**: Deploy Mage to [AWS](/production/deploying-to-cloud/aws/setup), [GCP](/production/deploying-to-cloud/gcp/setup), or [Azure](/production/deploying-to-cloud/azure/setup) with only 2 commands using maintained Terraform templates.
  - **Scaling made simple**: Transform very large datasets directly in your data warehouse or through a native integration with [Spark](/integrations/spark-pyspark).
  - **Observability**: Operationalize your pipelines with built-in monitoring, alerting, and observability through an intuitive UI.
