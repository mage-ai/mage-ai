## ü™Ñ Make data magical

- **Extract** and synchronize data from 3rd party sources.
- Build real-time and batch pipelines to **transform** data using Python, SQL, and R.
- **Load** data into your data warehouse or data lake using our pre-built connectors.
- Run, monitor, and **orchestrate** thousands of pipelines without losing sleep.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Build

Have you met anyone who said they loved developing in Airflow? That's why we
designed an easy developer experience that you'll enjoy.

- **Easy developer experience**: Start developing locally with a single command
  or launch a dev environment in your cloud using Terraform.
- **Language of choice**: Write code in Python, SQL, or R in the same data
  pipeline for ultimate flexibility.
- **Engineering best practices built-in**: Each step in your pipeline is a
  standalone file containing modular code that's reusable and testable with data
  validations. No more DAGs with spaghetti code.
- **Bring your favorite tools:** Write dbt models, use your favorite IDE, track changes with Git, and much more.

</p>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Preview

Stop wasting time waiting around for your DAGs to finish testing. Get instant
feedback from your code each time you run it.

- **Interactive code**: Immediately see results from your code's output with an
  interactive notebook UI.
- **Data is a first-class citizen**: Each block of code in your pipeline
  produces data that can be versioned, partitioned, and cataloged for future
  use.
- **Collaborate on cloud**: Develop collaboratively on cloud resources, version
  control with Git, and test pipelines without waiting for an available shared
  staging environment.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Launch

Don't have a large team dedicated to Airflow? Mage makes it easy for a single
developer or small team to scale up and manage thousands of pipelines.

- **Fast deploy**: Deploy Mage to AWS, GCP, or Azure with only 2 commands using
  maintained Terraform templates.
- **Scaling made simple**: Transform very large datasets directly in your data
  warehouse or through a native integration with Spark.
- **Observability**: Operationalize your pipelines with built-in monitoring,
  alerting, and observability through an intuitive UI.

## üõ∏ [Core abstractions](/design/core-abstractions)

These are the fundamental concepts that Mage uses to operate.

| [Project](/design/core-abstractions#project)           | Like a repository on GitHub; this is where you write all your code.                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Pipeline](/design/core-abstractions#pipeline)         | Contains references to all the blocks of code you want to run, charts for visualizing data, and organizes the dependency between each block of code.        |
| [Block](/design/core-abstractions#block)               | A file with code that can be executed independently or within a pipeline.                                                                                   |
| [Data product](/design/core-abstractions#data-product) | Every block produces data after it's been executed. These are called data products in Mage.                                                                 |
| [Trigger](/design/core-abstractions#trigger)           | A set of instructions that determine when or how a pipeline should run.                                                                                     |
| [Run](/design/core-abstractions#run)                   | Stores information about when it was started, its status, when it was completed, any runtime variables used in the execution of the pipeline or block, etc. |
