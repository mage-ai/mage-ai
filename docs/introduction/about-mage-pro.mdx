Mage Pro is a modern data pipeline tool designed to address data engineering challenges at scale. It’s a unified platform for data extraction, transformation, loading, and orchestration. It bridges the gap between raw data sources and analytics ready systems. Mage Pro is more performant, reliable, and cost effective than Mage OSS. 

Mage Pro can be deployed in 4 ways:

- **Mage Pro SaaS** - Is fully managed and your Mage code executes in our environment.
- **Mage Pro hybrid cloud** - Where Mage Pro infrastructure maintains the control plane, but the data plane is deployed in your cloud.
- **Mage Pro private cloud** - Both control and data plane are deployed in your cloud.
- **Mage Pro on-prem** - Where Mage Pro infrastructure is deployed on your on-prem servers.

Additionally, Mage Pro adds some core capabilities that are not found in the Mage OSS environment. True to Mage’s philosophy on developer implementation and collaboration, many of the additional features make Mage Pro even more developer friendly. Some of those core capabilities are:

- **Cluster health insights**, check how your clusters are performing in Mage Pro’s cluster manager insights application. Get pricing estimates and real time CPU and Memory usage.
- **Workspaces** - Segment one or more of your Mage Pro clusters into multiple development environments
- **CICD Deployments** - A powerful tool to easily deploy new versions of your code at the click of a button.
- **Pipeline dependency views** - Have pipelines that orchestrate or depend on other pipelines? Now you can have a view of this in this Mage Pro only application.

Mage’s SaaS offering can be deployed from any cloud region in the world. Currently Mage Pro is deployed in the following regions US West, US East, Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
