## Set up development environment

### macOS

1. Install Docker
   To setup Docker on Mac, follow the instructions at [Install Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/). To confirm that Docker is available, open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   % docker --version
   % docker run hello-world
   ```
2. Clone the Mage-ai repository:
   ```bash
   % git clone https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai.git
   ```
3. Create a new project:
   ```bash
   % cd mage-ai
   % ./scripts/init.sh [project_name]
   ```
4. Run the below script to build the Docker image and run all the services:
   ```bash
   % ./scripts/dev.sh [project]
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Windows

Some additional installations would be needed, as listed below:

#### Install Windows WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

* To install WSL on Windows, open Command Prompt as admin and run
```bash
$ wsl –install
```
It will install all the WSL2 components and the default Ubuntu Linux distro.
* To view a list of available WSL distros to install on Windows, run
```bash
$ wsl --list --online
```
* To install a specific distro, run
```bash
$ wsl –install -d <Distro>
```

#### Install Docker and Enable WSL Integration

Follow the instructions at [Get started with Docker remote containers on WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers), to install the Docker desktop and set up WSL integration in Docker.

To confirm that Docker is available in WSL, open a WSL terminal and run:
```bash
$ docker --version
$ docker run hello-world
```

Clone and start Mage using the same steps listed above for "macOS".

For all these operating systems, more information about setting up your local environment for development using virtual environments is available [here](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/blob/master/README_dev.md).

### Errors

#### Permission denied

If you get an error relating to permission denied when trying to execute a script,
it might have something to do with SELinux.

Two or more containers are trying to mount the same volume. With SELinux it’s not possible without
the `z` option.

For more information about using the `z` option,
read [Docker’s documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/).

## Debugging

Instead of using `breakpoint()`, add the following line to your code where you
want a debug:

```python
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

Attach to running container to use debugger. To get the container ID, run
`docker ps` and look in the `NAMES` column.

```bash
docker attach [container_id]
```
