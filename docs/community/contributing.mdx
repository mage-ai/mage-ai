## Set up development environment

1. Create a new project:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/init.sh [project_name]
   ```
2. Run the below script to build the Docker image and run all the services:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/dev.sh [project]
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Debugging

Instead of using `breakpoint()`, add the following line to your code where you
want a debug:

```python
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

Attach to running container to use debugger. To get the container ID, run
`docker ps` and look in the `NAMES` column.

```bash
docker attach [container_id]
```
