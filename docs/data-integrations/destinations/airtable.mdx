## FAQs

### What is `base_id` in Airtable?

The `base_id` is a unique identifier for your Airtable base. It typically starts with `app` and can be found in the base’s URL or retrieved using the Airtable API.

### How should I store my Airtable token securely?

Use environment variables or Mage’s secrets manager to store your token. Avoid hardcoding tokens in your configuration files or version control.

### Can Mage write data to multiple Airtable bases?

Yes, but you must configure each destination with its corresponding `base_id` and ensure the access token has permission for each base.
