## Credential Requirements

To use Amazon S3, you need an AWS IAM user or role with permissions to:

- Put objects (`s3:PutObject`)
- Create folders (`s3:PutObject`)
- Optionally assume roles (`sts:AssumeRole`) if `role_arn` is used

Ensure the credentials provided have appropriate access to the target bucket and path.

## FAQs

### Can I write to MinIO or other S3-compatible storage?

Yes. Set the `aws_endpoint` field to your custom endpoint URL (e.g., `https://play.min.io`). Ensure your credentials and permissions are configured accordingly.

### How are files named in S3?

Mage automatically handles file naming using table names and batch metadata. Your `object_key_path` acts as the prefix under which the files are written.

### What happens if I don’t set `date_partition_format`?

Files will be written directly into the specified path without date-based folder partitioning.

### What if both `role_arn` and access keys are set?

Mage will attempt to assume the IAM role using the provided access key credentials. This is helpful in cross-account setups or for short-lived access via STS.
