## Singer spec

Mage uses the data engineering community standard for data integrations called the
[Singer spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/SPEC.md).

In addition,
Mage further standardizes the spec and provides common classes and methods to make implementing them easier and faster.

## Folder structure

Destinations are defined in the `mage_integrations/destinations/` directory.

All destinations should be a subclass of the `Destination` class defined in
`mage_integrations/destinations/base.py`.

## Configs

* `maximum_batch_size_mb`: Destination processes records the batches. The maximum batch size can be configured.
