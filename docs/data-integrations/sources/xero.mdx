## Configuration

To set up the Xero source, provide the following configuration parameters:

| Key              | Description                                                                                   | Sample Value            | Required |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| `access_token`   | OAuth access token used to authenticate API requests.                                          | `abcdefg`               | ✅        |
| `id_token`       | Token containing user identity details (if OpenID Connect scopes are requested).              | `abcdefg`               | ✅        |
| `start_date`     | The start date for syncing data. Format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.                               | `2021-01-01T00:00:00Z`   | ✅        |
| `client_id`      | Client ID issued when you create your Xero app.                                                | `abcdefg`               | ✅        |
| `client_secret`  | Client secret generated when you create your Xero app.                                         | `abcdefg`               | ✅        |
| `tenant_id`      | Tenant ID associated with your Xero organization.                                              | `abcdefg`               | ✅        |
| `refresh_token`  | Refresh token used to renew the access token after expiration (requires `offline_access` scope). | `abcdefg`             | ✅        |

## Required Xero OAuth2 Scopes

To use this source, you must grant your Xero app the following OAuth2 scopes.

### Minimum Scope for Discovery
- `accounting.settings.read`
  Required for the `/Currencies` endpoint, which is called during discovery to verify:
  - Your `access_token` is valid
  - Your `tenant_id` is authorised
  - The app has the correct scopes

If this scope is missing, discovery will fail before any sync begins.

### Scopes for Syncing All Streams
To sync all available streams, grant the following scopes:

| Scope                        | Required For                              |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `accounting.settings.read`   | Organisation settings, currencies, etc.  |
| `accounting.transactions.read` | Invoices, bank transactions, payments   |
| `accounting.contacts.read`   | Contacts                                  |
| `accounting.reports.read`    | Reports                                   |
| `accounting.journals.read`   | Journals                                  |
| `accounting.attachments.read`| Attachments                               |
| `offline_access`             | Long-lived access via refresh tokens     |

**Note:**
- You only need scopes for the streams you plan to sync.
- Missing scopes for a selected stream will result in `401` or `403` errors.

### Example Scope String
```
accounting.settings.read
accounting.transactions.read
accounting.contacts.read
accounting.reports.read
accounting.journals.read
accounting.attachments.read
offline_access
```

## How to Generate Credentials

Follow Xero's [OAuth 2.0 Authentication Flow guide](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/auth-flow/) to generate the required credentials:

1. Register a new Xero app to get your `client_id` and `client_secret`.
2. Set up the OAuth scopes your app requires.
3. Complete the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow to obtain your `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `id_token`, and `tenant_id`.
4. Store these securely in your configuration.

## Additional Notes

- The `start_date` determines how far back data will be synced.
- Ensure that the `offline_access` scope is enabled to receive a `refresh_token`.
- Tokens expire after a set period; use the `refresh_token` to obtain new `access_token` and `id_token` values automatically.
- During setup, the connector calls the `/Currencies` endpoint to validate platform access before syncing.
