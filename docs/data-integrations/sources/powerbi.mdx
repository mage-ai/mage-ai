## What is Power BI?

[Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) is Microsoft’s leading business intelligence (BI) platform, enabling organizations to visualize data, create interactive dashboards, and generate real-time insights.  
Integrating Power BI with Mage allows you to automate data extraction, sync analytics reports, and merge insights across your enterprise data ecosystem.

## How to Get Your `access_token`

Follow Power BI’s [official instructions](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Developer/REST-API-Get-Access-Token/m-p/1895937/) to generate an OAuth `access_token` via the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) app registration process.
