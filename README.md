# Mage OSS

### Build modern data pipelines locally — fast, visual, and production-ready.

<br />

Mage OSS is a self-hosted development environment designed to help teams create production-grade data pipelines with confidence.

Ideal for automating ETL tasks, architecting data flow, or orchestrating transformations — all in a fast, notebook-style interface powered by modular code.

When it’s time to scale, [Mage Pro](https://mage.ai) — our core platform — unlocks enterprise orchestration, collaboration, and AI-powered workflows.
