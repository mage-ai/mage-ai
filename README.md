# Intro
Mage is an open-source data management platform
that helps you
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>clean data</b></span> and
prepare it for training AI/ML models.

### What does this do?
The current version of Mage includes a data cleaning UI tool that can run locally on your laptop or
can be hosted in your own cloud environment.

### Why should I use it?
Using a data cleaning tool enables you to quickly visualize data quality issues,
easily fix them, and create repeatable data cleaning pipelines that can be used in
production environments (e.g. online re-training, inference, etc).

# Quick start

### Install library
Install the most recent released version:
```bash
$ pip install mage-ai
```

Or install the current build on GitHub:
```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai.git
```

### Launch tool
Load your data, connect it to Mage, and launch the tool locally.


From anywhere you can execute Python code (e.g. terminal, Jupyter notebook, etc.),
run the following:

```python
import mage_ai
import pandas as pd


df = pd.read_csv('/path_to_data')
mage_ai.connect_data(df, name='name_of_dataset')
mage_ai.launch()
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser to access the tool locally.

To stop the tool, run this command: `mage_ai.kill()`

### Cleaning data
After building a data cleaning pipeline from the UI,
you can clean your data anywhere you can execute Python code:

```python
import mage_ai
import pandas as pd


df = pd.read_csv('/path_to_data')

# Option 1: Clean with pipeline uuid
df_cleaned = mage_ai.clean(df, pipeline_uuid='uuid_of_cleaning_pipeline')

# Option 2: Clean with pipeline config directory path
df_cleaned = mage_ai.clean(df, pipeline_config_path='/path_to_pipeline_config_dir')
```

### Data visualizations
Inspect your data using different charts (e.g. time series, bar chart, box plot, etc.).

Here‚Äôs a list of available [charts](docs/charts/README.md).

### Reports
Quickly diagnose data quality issues with summary reports.

Here‚Äôs a list of available [reports](docs/reports/README.md).

  style="border: 1px solid gray; border-radius: 8px;"
/>

### Cleaning actions
Easily add common cleaning functions to your pipeline with a few clicks.
Cleaning actions include imputing missing values, reformatting strings, removing duplicates,
and many more.

If a cleaning action you need doesn‚Äôt exist in the library,
you can write and save custom cleaning functions in the UI.

Here‚Äôs a list of available [cleaning actions](docs/actions/README.md).

  style="border: 1px solid gray; border-radius: 8px;"
/>

### Data cleaning suggestions
The tool will automatically suggest different ways to clean your data and improve quality metrics.

Here‚Äôs a list of available [suggestions](docs/suggestions/README.md).

# Roadmap
Big features being worked on or in the design phase.

1. Encoding actions (e.g. one-hot encoding, label hasher, ordinal encoding, embeddings, etc.)
1. Data quality monitoring and alerting
1. Apply cleaning actions to columns and values that match a condition

Here‚Äôs a detailed list of [ü™≤ features and bugs](https://airtable.com/shrE1pn6fRsVlniOV)
that are in progress or upcoming.
