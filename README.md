## Introduction
Mage AI aims to simplify data pre-processing. With a few lines of code, you can:
- Create a data cleaning pipeline and clean your data with a few clicks.
- Automatically generate cleaning suggestions in your local notebook
- Display feature-specific statistics and visualizations
- Easily detect "holes" and anomalies in your data

Coming soon:
- Export data cleaning pipeline and integrate into your production data pipelines.
- Access faster data analysis and cleaning using Mage's public cloud server.
- Support user defined cleaning functions within the UI.
- Perform no-code data transformations within the UI.

## Installation

You can install the latest version from Github
```
pip install git+https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai.git
```

## Getting Started
Within your [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), the following 4 lines of code connects Mage with your data to generate data cleaning suggestions and data insights.
```python
import mage_ai

df = pd.read_csv('/path_to_your_dataset')
feature_set = mage_ai.connect_data(df, name='test_data')
mage_ai.launch()
```

## Usage
An example dashboard connected to purchasing data shows `Suggested actions` and `Reports`.

In `Suggested actions`, you can edit and apply suggested data cleaning actions. `Reports` provides feature-specific reports statistics that make it obvious if there are missing, duplicates, or anomalies in your data.

In addition, the dashboard displays column-specific summaries, further suggestions, and `Visualizations`. These help you identify correlations between your features, which sometimes leads to data leakage. Since Mage is open source, these charts and visualizations are customizable. ðŸ˜‰
